<h4>Anti-positivist Interpretive Social Science</h4>
Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of
significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and
the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in
search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.

<p>
It is
explication I am after, construing social expressions on their surface
enigmatical.
And it is not even, finally, meanings that I am after,
but rather significances.

<p>Culture is not a power, something to which
social events, behaviors, institutions, or processes can be causally
attributed; it is a context, something within which they can be
intelligibly— that is, thickly— described. In brief, a little thicker
description is what we need in this life, and that is what, I am here
to argue, ethnography, properly conceived as a thick description of
particular social situations, does indeed provide.

<p>The task of the
ethnographer is to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar,
to take, as it were, the native's point of view, to get inside his
head and see the world the way he does, to delineate the ethos of his
culture as that ethos is manifested in actual behavio

**Religion as a Symbolic System**

An essay first published in 1966, appearing as chapter 4 of 1973 <u>Interpretation of Culture</u>, it begins
with this epigraph from George Santayana:

<i>
<blockquote>
Any attempt to speak without speaking any particular language is not
more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no
religion in particular.… Thus every living and healthy religion has a
marked idiosyncrasy. Its power consists in its special and surprising
message and in the bias which that revelation gives to life. The
vistas it opens and the mysteries it propounds are another world to
live in; and another world to live in—whether we expect ever to pass
wholly over into it or no—is what we mean by having a
religion.</i>
</blockquote>

Geertz defines religion as:

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<details>
   <summary>a system of symbols which acts to</summary>

<br>
Such a tremendous weight is being put on the term "symbol" here
that our first move must be to decide with some precision what we are
going to mean by it. This is no easy task, for, rather like "culture,"
"symbol" has been used to refer to a great variety of things, often a
number of them at the same time.
<p>
In some hands it is used for anything which signifies something else
to someone: dark clouds are the symbolic precursors of an on-coming
rain. In others it is used only for explicitly conventional signs of one
sort or another: a red flag is a symbol of danger, a white of surrender.
In others it is confined to something which expresses in an oblique and
figurative manner that which cannot be stated in a direct and literal one,
so that there are symbols in poetry but not in science, and symbolic
logic is misnamed. In yet others, however, it is used for any object, act,
event, quality, or relation which serves as a vehicle .for a conception—
the conception is the symbol's "meaning"—and that is the approach I
shall follow here.  (See 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Langer" target="_blank">Langer, Philosophy in a New Key</a>.)
<p>

The number 6, written, imagined, laid out as a row of stones, or even
punched into the program tapes of a computer, is a symbol. But so also
is the Cross, talked about, visualized, shaped worriedly in air or
fondly fingered at the neck, the expanse of painted canvas called
"Guernica" or the bit of painted stone called a churinga, the word
"reality," or even the morpheme "-ing." They are all symbols, or at
least symbolic elements, because they are tangible formulations of
notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms,
concrete embodiments of ideas, attitudes, judgments, longings, or
beliefs.  To undertake the study of cultural activity—activity in
which symbolism forms the positive content—is thus not to abandon
social analysis for a Platonic cave of shadows, to enter into a
mentalistic world of introspective psychology or, worse, speculative
philosophy, and wander there forever in a haze of "Cognitions,"
"Affections," "Conations," and other elusive entities. Cultural acts,
the construction, apprehension, and utilization of symbolic forms, are
social events like any other; they are as public as marriage and as
observable as agriculture.
<p>
They are not, however, exactly the same thing; or, more precisely,
the symbolic dimension of social events is, like the psychological, itself
theoretically abstractable from those events as empirical totalities.
There is still, to paraphrase a remark of Kenneth Burke's, a difference
between building a house and drawing up a plan for building a house,
and reading a poem about having children by marriage is not quite the
same thing as having children by marriage.
<p>

Even though the building of the house may proceed under the guidance
of the plan or—a less likely occurrence—the having of children may be
motivated by a reading of the poem, there is something to be said for
not confusing our traffic with symbols with our traffic with objects
or human beings, for these latter are not in themselves symbols,
however often they may function as such.
<p>

No matter how deeply interfused the cultural, the social, and the
psychological may be in the everyday life of houses, farms, poems, and
marriages, it is useful to distinguish them in analysis, and, so
doing, to isolate the generic traits of each against the normalized
background of the other two. So far as culture patterns, that is,
systems or complexes of symbols, are concerned, the generic trait
which is of first importance for us here is that they are extrinsic
sources of information. By "extrinsic," I mean only that—unlike genes,
for example—they lie outside the boundaries of the individual organism
as such in that intersubjective world of common understandings into
which all human individuals are born, in which they pursue their
separate careers, and which they leave persisting behind them after
they die.

<p>By "sources of information," I mean only that—like
genes—they provide a blueprint or template in terms of which processes
external to themselves can be given a definite form. As the order of
bases in a strand of DNA forms a coded program, a set of instructions,
or a recipe, for the synthesis of the structurally complex proteins
which shape organic functioning, so culture patterns provide such
programs for the institution of the social and psychological processes
which shape public behavior. Though the sort of information and the
mode of its transmission are vastly different in the two cases, this
comparison of gene and symbol is more than a strained analogy of the
familiar "social heredity" sort. It is actually a substantial
relationship, for it is precisely because of the fact that genetically
programmed processes are so highly generalized in men, as compared
with lower animals, that culturally programmed ones are so important; only because
human behavior is so loosely determined by intrinsic sources of information that extrinsic sources are so vital. To build a dam a beaver
needs only an appropriate site and the proper materials—his mode of
procedure is shaped by his physiology.

<p>But man, whose genes are silent on the building trades, needs also
a conception of what it is to build a dam, a conception he can get
only from some symbolic source—a blueprint, a textbook, or a string of
speech by someone who already knows how dams are built—or, of course,
from manipulating graphic or linguistic elements in such a way as to
attain for himself a conception of what dams are and how they are
built.  This point is sometimes put in the form of an argument that
cultural patterns are "models," that they are sets of symbols whose
relations to one another "model" relations among entities, processes
or what-haveyou in physical, organic, social, or psychological systems
by "paralleling," "imitating," or "simulating" them.8

<p> The term "model" has, however, two senses—an "of" sense and a
"for" sense—and though these are but aspects of the same basic concept
they are very much worth distinguishing for analytic purposes. In the
first, what is stressed is the manipulation of symbol structures so as
to bring them, more or less closely, into parallel with the
pre-established nonsymbolic system, as when we grasp how dams work by
developing a theory of hydraulics or constructing a flow chart. The
theory or chart models physical relationships in such a way—that is,
by expressing their structure in synoptic form—as to render them
apprehensible; it is a model of "reality." In the second, what is
stressed is the manipulation of the nonsymbolic systems in terms of
the relationships expressed in the symbolic, as when we construct a
dam according to the specifications implied in an hydraulic theory or
the conclusions drawn from a flow chart. Here, the theory is a model
under whose guidance physical relationships are organized: it is a
model for "reality." For psychological and social systems, and for
cultural models that we would not ordinarily refer to as "theories,"
but rather as "doctrines," "melodies," or "rites," the case is in no
way different. Unlike genes, and other nonsymbolic information
sources, which are only models for, not models of, culture patterns
have an intrinsic double aspect: they give meaning, that is, objective
conceptual form, to social and psychological reality both by shaping
themselves to it and by shaping it to themselves.

<p> ther sorts of significative forms. Models for are found, as the
gene example suggests, through the whole order of nature; for wherever
there is a communication of pattern, such programs are, in simple
logic, required. Among animals, imprint learning is perhaps the most
striking example, because what such learning involves is the automatic
presentation of an appropriate sequence of behavior by a model animal
in the presence of a learning animal which serves, equally
automatically, to call out and stabilize a certain set of responses
genetically built into the learning animal.9 The communicative dance
of two bees, one of which has found nectar and the other of which
seeks it, is another, somewhat different, more complexly coded,
example.10 Craik has even suggested that the thin trickle of water
which first finds its way down from a mountain spring to the sea and
smooths a little channel for the greater volume of water that follows
after it plays a sort of model for function.11 But models
of—linguistic, graphic, mechanical, natural, etc., processes which
function not to provide sources of information in terms of which other
processes can be patterned, but to represent those patterned processes
as such, to express their structure in an alternative medium—are much
rarer and may perhaps be confined, among living animals, to man. The
perception of the structural congruence between one set of processes,
activities, relations, entities, and so on, and another set for which
it acts as a program, so that the program can be taken as a
representation, or conception—a symbol—of the programmed, is the
essence of human thought. The intertransposability of models for and
models of which symbolic formulation makes possible is the distinctive
characteristic of our mentality.

<br>
So far as religious symbols and symbol systems are concerned this
intertransposability is clear. The endurance, courage, independence,
perseverance, and passionate willfulness in which the vision quest
practices the Plains Indian are the same flamboyant virtues by which
he attempts to live: while achieving a sense of revelation he
stabilizes a sense of direction. The consciousness of defaulted
obligation, secreted guilt, and, when a confession is obtained, public
shame in which Manus' seance rehearses him are the same sentiments
that underlie the sort of duty ethic by which his property-conscious
society is maintained: the gaining of an absolution involves the
forging of a conscience.13 And the same self-discipline which rewards
a Javanese mystic staring fixedly into the flame of a lamp with what
he takes to be an intimation of divinity drills him in that rigorous
control of emotional expression which is necessary to a man who would
follow a quietistic style of life.14 Whether one sees the conception
of a personal guardian spirit, a family tutelary, or an immanent God
as synoptic formulations of the character of reality or as templates
for producing reality with such a character seems largely arbitrary, a
matter of which aspect, the model of or model for, one wants for the
moment to bring into focus. The concrete symbols involved--one or
another mythological figure materializing in the wilderness, the skull
of the deceased household head hanging censoriously in the rafters, or
a disembodied "voice in the stillness" soundlessly chanting enigmatic
classical poetry--point in either direction. They both express the
world's climate and shape it.

<p> 

They shape it by inducing in the worshipper a certain distinctive set
of dispositions (tendencies, capacities, propensities, skills, habits,
liabilities, pronenesses) which lend a chronic character to the flow
of his activity and the quality of his experience. A disposition
describes not an activity or an occurrence but a probability of an
activity being performed or an occurrence occurring in certain
circumstances: "When a cow is said to be a ruminant, or a man is said
to be a cigarette-smoker, it is not being said that the cow is
ruminating now or that the man is smoking a cigarette now. To be a
ruminant is to tend to ruminate from time to time, and to be a
cigarette-smoker is to be in the habit of smoking cigarettes."15
Similarly, to be pious is not to be performing something we would call
an act of piety, but to be liable to perform such acts. So, too, with
the Plains Indian's bravura, the Manus' compunctiousness, or the
Javanese's quietism, which, in their contexts, form the substance of
piety. The virtue of this sort of view of what are usually called
"mental traits" or, if the Cartesianism is unavowed, "psychological
forces" (both unobjectionable enough terms in themselves) is that it
gets them out of any dim and inaccessible realm of private sensation
into that same well-lit world of observables in which reside the
brittleness of glass, the inflammability of paper, and, to return to
the metaphor, the dampness of England.
<p>

So far as religious activities are concerned (and learning a myth by
heart is as much a religious activity as detaching one's finger at the
knuckle), two somewhat different sorts of disposition are induced by
them: moods and motivations.

<p> 

A motivation is a persisting tendency, a chronic inclination to
perform certain sorts of acts and experience certain sorts of feeling
in certain sorts of situations, the "sorts" being commonly very
heterogenous and rather ill-defined classes in all three cases:
<p>

On hearing that a man is vain [i.e., motivated by vanity] we expect
him to behave in certain ways, namely to talk a lot about himself, to
cleave to the society of the eminent, to reject criticisms, to seek
the footlights and to disengage himself from conversations about the
merits of others. We expect him to indulge in roseate daydreams about
his own successes, to avoid recalling past failures and to plan for
his own advancement. To be vain is to tend to act in these and
innumerable other kindred ways. Certainly we also expect the vain man
to feel certain pangs and flutters in certain situations; we expect
him to have an acute sinking feeling when an eminent person forgets
his name, and to feel buoyant of heart and light of toe on hearing of
the misfortunes of his rivals. But feelings of pique and buoyancy are
not more directly indicative of vanity than are public acts of
boasting or private acts of daydreaming.16
<p>

Similarly for any motivations. As a motive, "flamboyant courage"
consists in such enduring propensities as to fast in the wilderness,
to conduct solitary raids on enemy camps, and to thrill to the thought
of counting coup. "Moral circumspection" consists in such ingrained
tendencies as to honor onerous promises, to confess secret sins in the
face of severe public disapproval, and to feel guilty when vague and
generalized accusations are made at seances. And "dispassionate
tranquility" consists in such persistent inclinations as to maintain
one's poise come hell or high water, to experience distaste in the
presence of even moderate emotional displays, and to indulge in
contentless contemplations of featureless objects. Motives are thus
neither acts (that is, intentional behaviors) nor feelings, but
liabilities to perform particular classes of act or have particular
classes of feeling. And when we say that a man is religious, that is,
motivated by religion, this is at least part--though only part--of
what we mean.

<p> 

Another part of what we mean is that he has, when properly stimulated,
a susceptibility to fall into certain moods, moods we sometimes lump
together under such covering terms as "reverential," "solemn," or
"worshipful." Such generalized rubrics actually conceal, however, the
enormous empirical variousness of the dispositions involved, and, in
fact, tend to assimilate them to the unusually grave tone of most of
our own religious life. The moods that sacred symbols induce, at
different times and in different places, range from exultation to
melancholy, from self-confidence to self-pity, from an incorrigible
playfulness to a bland listlessness--to say nothing of the erogenous
power of so many of the world's myths and rituals. No more than there
is a single sort of motivation one can call piety is there a single
sort of mood one can call worshipful.

 
<p>

The major difference between moods and motivations is that where the
latter are, so to speak, vectorial qualities, the former are merely
scalar. Motives have a directional cast, they describe a certain
overall course, gravitate toward certain, usually temporary,
consummations. But moods vary only as to intensity: they go
nowhere. They spring from certain circumstances but they are
responsive to no ends. Like fogs, they just settle and lift; like
scents, suffuse and evaporate. When present they are totalistic: if
one is sad everything and everybody seems dreary; if one is gay,
everything and everybody seems splendid. Thus, though a man can be
vain, brave, willful, and independent at the same time, he can't very
well be playful and listless, or exultant and melancholy, at the same
time.17 Further, where motives persist for more or less extended
periods of time, moods merely recur with greater or lesser frequency,
coming and going for what are often quite unfathomable reasons. But
perhaps the most important difference, so far as we are concerned,
between moods and motivations is that motivations are "made
meaningful" with reference to the ends toward which they are conceived
to conduce, whereas moods are "made meaningful" with reference to the
conditions from which they are conceived to spring. We interpret
motives in terms of their consummations, but we interpret moods in
terms of their sources. We say that a person is industrious because he
wishes to succeed; we say that a person is worried because he is
conscious of the hanging threat of nuclear holocaust. And this is no
less the case when the interpretations are ultimate. Charity becomes
Christian charity when it is enclosed in a conception of God's
purposes; optimism is Christian optimism when it is grounded in a
particular conception of God's nature. The assiduity of the Navaho
finds its rationale in a belief that, since "reality" operates
mechanically, it is coercible; their chronic fearfulness finds its
rationale in a conviction that, however "reality" operates, it is both
enormously powerful and terribly dangerous.

<details>
   <summary>Tulalip Tribe's summary</summary>

From the Tulalip Tribe's <a href="https://tulaliplushootseed.com/story-tellers/harry-moses/" target="_blank">website</a>:

Harry Moses was born on November 15, 1878 up the Skagit river Valley
in the town of Marblemount. Harry and his wife Jessie had eight
children, William Moses, Zatha Moses, Regina Moses Dallaire, Persina H
Moses, Mahcina L Moses, Rydnillo W Moses, Anna B Moses and Arnold C
Moses.
<p>
Harry’s father was Will-Ab-To-Chub Charley Moses, who was born in  1853.
 His mother was Sha-Sha-Bow-Lits-Ah or Mary, she was born in  1852. Jesse’s father was Bon-Quah-am.

<p>
The Moses family were heavily involved with their relatives and fellow
members of the Shaker church. They lived mainly in the Upper Skagit
area, around Marblemount. They spent a good deal of time with the
Anderson family. Vi Hilbert in Haboo wrote that her, and her parents,
visited quite often because her parents thoroughly enjoyed each
other’s company. She wrote, “I loved to listen in.

Harry had a wonderful sense of humor, which was well known. He loved
to tell stories and his audience knew that they could count on him to
embellish the facts, with a twinkle in his eyes. Why, Harry saw the
eyes of the woman in the moon, and the fish he caught in the Cascade
river behind his house were so big that when he lifted them onto his
shoulder, the tails would drag far behind him on the ground.

Harry died on October 24, 1955 in Sedro-Woolley.

  <summary>An indirect account of Harry Moses's social setting</summary>

(from the introduction to Sally Snyder's dissertation, 
Skagit society and its existential basis: an ethnofolkloristic reconstruction. University of Washington, 1964)

Non-reservation Indians who lived in and near towns were descended
from people who inhabited areas less accessible and attractive to
Whites. Those Skagits had resisted in battle removal to
reservations. Except for that unfortunate meeting with Whites who were
of the military, and a few surveyors and miners passing through now
and then, significant contacts with Caucasians were not until after
1875 with the first pioneer settlers in their area.

During the years I knew non-reservation Skagits they were also
surrounded by White neighbors and were even more of a minority
population where they lived than Reservation Indians. But they were
economically independent, with standards of living which did not
distinguish them from Caucasian neighbors. They seemed to have been
socially and psychologically more stable than reservation
people. Despite the physical isolation of upriver families from other
Indians - so different from the community setting of reservations -
 there was more unity among them. Cultural decay had progressed no
further, if as far, than for reservation Skagits. But it had been
supplanted by Western elements which had led not to the
disorganization, disturbances, and hopelessness I saw on the
Reservation, but to a degree of positive identification as being both
Indians and members of a predominantly White community.

In the years I knew and worked with Skagits on the Reservation and
elsewhere, only memories about native culture had been preserved
intact, and these were limited to the elderly and a few of the
middle-aged. No one under forty spoke or understood more than a few
words of an Indian language. My researches were on last survivors of
an aboriginal culture.
