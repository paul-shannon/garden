**Preface to the Territories of Science and Religion, Peter Harrison, 2015**

My synopsis:

   - The atrophy of the virtues of _scientia_ and _religio_, and the
     increasing emphasis on their exterior manifestations in the
     sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, will be discussed in more
     detail in chapter 4. But looking ahead we can say that in the
     physical realm virtues and powers were removed from natural
     objects and replaced by a notion of external law. The order of
     things will now be understood in terms of laws of nature - a
     conception that makes its first appearance in the seventeenth
     century - and these laws will take the place of those inherent
     tendencies within things that strive for their perfection.

   - In the moral sphere, a similar development takes
     place, and human virtues will be subordinated to an idea of
     divinely imposed laws - in this instance, moral laws. The
     virtues - moral and intellectual - will be understood in terms of
     their capacity to produce the relevant behaviors or bodies of
     knowledge. What drives both of these shifts is the rejection of
     an Aristotelian and scholastic teleology, and the subsequent
     demise of the classical understanding of virtue will underpin the
     early modern transformation of the ideas of _scientia_ and _religio_.

   - Harrison begins: If a historian were to contend that he or she
     had discovered evidence of a hitherto unknown war that had broken
     out in the year 1600 between Israel and Egypt, this claim would
     be treated with some skepticism. The idea of a medieval Israel
     and a medieval Egypt could only come about through the mistaken
     application of our present maps onto past territories.

   - Similarly, _scientia_  and _religio_, current until the early modern,
     "science" only with the 19th C, were not at war as they are often
     today.

   - “natural history” and “natural philosophy” came together under
     the rubric “science” for the first time in the nineteenth
     century. These activities had involved quite different approaches
     to the study of nature and arguably their modern
     descendents—biology and physics—still exhibit the vestiges of
     their genealogical past.


   - Aquinas explains that in its primary sense _religio_ refers to
     interior acts of devotion and prayer, and that this interior
     dimension is more important than any outward expressions of this
     virtue. Aquinas acknowledges that a range of outward behaviors
     are associated with _religio_ — vows, tithes, offerings, and so
     on — but he regards these as secondary.

   - With Luther, _religio_ became _religion_, as seen in catechisms,
     500 in print by the 18th century.  Luther admonished parents to
     quiz their children weekly on the articles of faith.

   - Jerome’s choice of _religio_ for his translation of the relatively
     uncommon Greek thrēskeia in James 1:27 similarly associates the
     word with cult and worship. In the English of the King James
     version the verse is rendered: “Pure and undefiled religion
     [thrēskeia] before God the Father is this, To visit the
     fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
     unspotted from the world.”11 The import of this passage is that
     the “religion” of the Christians is a form of worship that
     consists in charitable acts rather than rituals. Here the
     contrast is between religion that is “vain” (vana) and that which
     is “pure and undefiled” (_religio_ munda et inmaculata).12 In the
     Middle Ages this came to be regarded as equivalent to a
     distinction between true and false religion.


   - Aquinas: we consider what he has to say on the notion of science
     (_scientia_) we find an intriguing parallel to his remarks on
     _religio_. In an extended treatment of the virtues in the Summa
     theologiae, Aquinas observes that science (_scientia_) is a habit
     of mind or an “intellectual virtue.”26 The parallel with _religio_,
     then, lies in the fact that we are now used to thinking of both
     religion and science as systems of beliefs and practices, rather
     than conceiving of them primarily as personal qualities. And for
     us today the question of their relationship is largely determined
     by their respective doctrinal content and the methods through
     which that content is arrived at. For Aquinas, however, both
     _religio_ and _scientia_ were, in the first place, personal
     attributes.

   - We are also accustomed to think of virtues as belonging entirely
     within the sphere of morality. But again, for Aquinas, a virtue
     is understood more generally as a “habit” that perfects the
     powers that individuals possess.27 This conviction—that human
     beings have natural powers that move them toward particular
     ends—was related to a general approach associated with the Greek
     philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC), who had taught that all
     natural things are moved by intrinsic tendencies toward certain
     goals (telē).

   - In the Middle Ages both notions have a significant interior
     dimension, and that what happens in the early modern period is
     that the balance between the interior and exterior begins to tip
     in favor of the latter. Over the course of the sixteenth and
     seventeenth centuries we will witness the beginning of a process
     in which the idea of religion and science as virtues or habits of
     mind begins to be overshadowed by the modern, systematic entities
     “science” and “religion.” In the case of _scientia_, then, the
     interior qualities that characterized the intellectual virtue of
     _scientia_ are transferred to methods and doctrines. The entry for
     “science” in the 1771 Encyclopaedia Britannica thus reads, in its
     entirety: “SCIENCE, in philosophy, denotes any doctrine, deduced
     from self-evident and certain principles, by a regular
     demonstration.”45 The logical rigor that had once been primarily
     a personal characteristic now resides primarily in the
     corresponding body of knowledge.

   - The other significant difference between the virtues of _religio_
     and _scientia_ lies in the relation of the interior and exterior
     elements. In the case of _religio_, the acts of worship are
     secondary in the sense that they are motivated by an inner
     piety. In the case of _scientia_, it is the rehearsal of the
     processes of demonstration that strengthens the relevant mental
     habit. Crucially, because the primary goal is the augmentation of
     mental habits, gained through familiarity with systematic bodies
     of knowledge (“the sciences”), the emphasis was less on the
     production of scientific knowledge than on the rehearsal of the
     scientific knowledge that already existed. Again, as noted
     earlier, this was because the “growth” of science was understood
     as taking place within the mind of the individual. In the
     present, of course, whatever vestiges of the scientific habitus
     remain in the mind of the modern scientist are directed toward
     the production of new scientific knowledge. In so far as they
     exist at all—and for the most part they have been projected
     outward onto experimental protocols—they are a means and not the
     end. Overstating the matter somewhat, in the Middle Ages
     scientific knowledge was an instrument for the inculcation of
     scientific habits of mind; now scientific habits of mind are
     cultivated primarily as an instrument for the production of
     scientific knowledge.


   - Before Luther, and consistent with spiritual practices of (for instance)
     the Stoics, the religious life was less about doctrine, more
     about cultivating piety, _habitus_, practice: salvation by good
     works and attitude. This changed with the Reformation, which
     held that individuals were not justified by virtue of an inner quality,
     whether acquired or infused, but on account of their relationship
     to God ... as determined solely by Divine will."

     "An analogous change was subsequently to take place in the sphere
     of natural philosophy, with patterns in the natural world being
     understood no longer in terms of the inner qualities of things,
     but rather as ordered relationships imposed on the world directly
     by the will of God. In the spheres of morality and natural
     philosophy, laws of nature thus came to assume the role
     previously played by inherent virtues."

     "English poet John Milton represented the pagan understanding of
     the virtues in Paradise Regained, he noted that the philosophers
     had been ignorant of “how Man fell” and that because of this they
     had mistakenly sought virtue “in themselves.”  It was not
     merely moral capacities that had been damaged by the Fall, for
     the consequences of original sin extended to the intellectual
     faculties as well, thus encompassing both _religio_ (a moral
     virtue) and _scientia_ (an intellectual virtue). Understood in this
     light, Calvin’s notorious doctrine of “total depravity” was less
     about the extreme nature of the depravity suffered by human
     beings than about the fact that depravity extended to every human
     faculty, including the intellectual.”

  - _scienta"

  - "motifs of self-cultivation and self-mastery that had been central
    to classical accounts of philosophy, and which to some degree had
    found their way into medieval understandings of human ends, would
    now be directed outward onto the world. The goals of human life
    will be placed within a pattern of redemption history in which the
    way back to God involves reestablishing mastery of the natural
    world that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall. This
    realigned understanding of true human ends thus eroded the
    significance of the virtues of _religio_ and _scientia_ by undermining
    the assumptions upon which they rested. At the same time, it led
    to the establishment of a set of religious justifications for the
    practical dominion over nature that would motivate the new
    sciences of the seventeenth century and set the scene for the
    emergence of the modern idea of science as a set of techniques
    directed toward mastery of the natural world."
     
   

This book is a revised version of the Gifford Lectures, delivered at
the University of Edinburgh in February 2011. The lectures sought to
address the history of two overlapping sets of concerns—those to do
with the nature of the physical universe and its operations, and those
that concern the goals of human existence and the source of our moral
values. We now tend to think of these questions as belonging to the
distinct domains of science and religion. When we look to the past,
however, we see that the boundaries of these two domains have been
understood very differently and that questions concerning ultimate
human meaning and value were rarely divorced from understandings of
the nature of the universe. In one sense, then, this book is about the
history of science and religion in the West. But it would be more
accurate to say that it seeks to describe how it is that we have come
to understand the world in terms of these distinct categories
“science” and “religion”—how, in other words, we have come to separate
the domain of material facts from the realm of moral and religious
values.

This subject matter brings with it two particular
challenges. The first should be more or less immediately
apparent. This book cannot be a straightforward history of the
relations between science and religion, since my argument is that
these two ideas, as they are presently understood, are relatively
recent conceptions that emerged in the West over the course of the
past three hundred years. What I have sought to do, then, is to
examine past activities that we have typically thought of in those
terms, or have regarded as leading to them. A significant part of this
exercise will be a consideration of the fortunes of the Latin terms
_scientia_ and _religio_. These two notions both begin as inner qualities
of the individual—“ virtues,” if you will—before becoming concrete and
abstract entities that are understood primarily in terms of doctrines
and practices. This process of objectification is the precondition for
a relationship between science and religion. In addition to a
consideration of the Latin terms from which our modern English words
“science” and “religion” derive, we shall also trace changing
constellations of other conceptions that are genealogically related to
our modern ideas of science and religion. They include “philosophy,”
“natural philosophy,” “theology,” “belief,” and “doctrine,” all of
which had meanings for past historical actors that are quite
unfamiliar to us today. One of my suggestions will be that there is a
danger of systematically misconstruing past activities if we
mistakenly assume the stability of meaning of these expressions.

A second challenge concerns the historical range of this book, which
begins with classical Greece and early Christianity, and extends into
the late nineteenth century. This may seem rather ambitious,
particularly in light of a trend in the academy toward tight
historical specialization. But this scope is necessary, in part
because I am seeking to call into question common narratives about the
trajectory of science that mirror this scale, beginning with its birth
among the ancient Greeks, its decline in the Christian Middle Ages,
its revival with the scientific revolution, and final triumph with the
professionalization of science in the nineteenth century. It is also
relevant that as a historical religion, modern Christianity still
measures itself against its earliest forms, and this warrants paying
attention to the early Christian era. That said, I have not attempted
to provide a comprehensive history of the manifold ways in which, in
the West, the study of the natural world was related to broader
philosophical and religious concerns. Rather I have tried to “drill
down” into particular historical moments, before moving on to conduct
similar exercises for later historical periods. This comparative
sampling approach will inevitably leave out some important parts of
the story, but it does enable us to take stock of relevant notions at
various points in history and make an assessment of the changes they
have undergone. These gaps in the narrative also make it difficult to
specify causes for all of the transitions that are identified, and in
any case questions of historical causation are notoriously
difficult. Nevertheless I will offer some suggestions about why what I
consider to be the key transitions happen when they do.

The book is
the culmination of a number of projects that I have been working on
over the past twenty years, beginning with my early researches into
our Western notion “religion” and taking in more recent work on the
identity of philosophy and science in different historical periods and
on the historical relations between science and religion. I will
repeat versions of some arguments that I have advanced before, but the
book offers what I believe is an entirely new perspective on these
issues, particularly in its attempt to more closely relate the history
of moral philosophy to the history of science. In relation to the
lectures as delivered, while I have made significant revisions and
additions, the six chapters of the book match the content of the six
original lectures (in some cases more closely than in others). The
first chapter offers a compressed overview of the general argument,
and subsequent chapters fill out the details. I have also added
scholarly apparatus in the form of fairly substantial endnotes for
those interested in following up sources or who wish to pursue
individual points in a little more detail. The notes will enable me to
keep more arcane discussions out of the text and maintain at least
some of the style of the oral presentations. In keeping with the
original tone of the lectures on which this book is based, I have
tried simply to tell the story, and have refrained (or at least have
attempted to refrain) from intruding more recondite theoretical
reflections into the narrative. That said, I have added a short
epilogue in which I offer some brief remarks on theoretical matters
along with observations on how my account relates to other discussions
of the history of Western modernity.”

"aristotle-finalism":
`
Aristotle defines the end, purpose, or final "cause" (τέλος,
télos) as that for the sake of which a thing is done. Like the
form, this is a controversial type of explanation in science; some
have argued for its survival in evolutionary biology, while Ernst
Mayr denied that it continued to play a role. It is commonly
recognised that Aristotle's conception of nature is teleological
in the sense that Nature exhibits functionality in a more general
sense than is exemplified in the purposes that humans have. Aristotle
observed that a telos does not necessarily involve deliberation,
intention, consciousness, or intelligence:

This is most obvious in the animals other than man: they make things
neither by art nor after inquiry or deliberation. That is why people
wonder whether it is by intelligence or by some other faculty that
these creatures work, – spiders, ants, and the like... It is absurd to
suppose that purpose is not present because we do not observe the
agent deliberating. Art does not deliberate. If the ship-building art
were in the wood, it would produce the same results by nature. If,
therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature.

— Aristotle, Physics, II.8

According to Aristotle, a seed has the eventual adult plant as its end
(i.e., as its telos) if and only if the seed would become the adult
plant under normal circumstances. In Physics II.9, Aristotle
hazards a few arguments that a determination of the end (i.e., final
cause) of a phenomenon is more important than the others. He argues
that the end is that which brings it about, so for example "if one
defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing,
then this cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain
kind; and these cannot be unless it is of iron." According to
Aristotle, once a final "cause" is in place, the material, efficient
and formal "causes" follow by necessity. However, he recommends that
the student of nature determine the other "causes" as well, and
notes that not all phenomena have an end, e.g., chance events.

Aristotle saw that his biological investigations provided insights
into the causes of things, especially into the final cause:

We should approach the investigation of every kind of animal without
being ashamed, since in each one of them there is something natural
and something beautiful. The absence of chance and the serving of ends
are found in the works of nature especially. And the end, for the sake
of which a thing has been constructed or has come to be, belongs to
what is beautiful.

— Aristotle, On the Parts of Animals 645a 21–26, Book I, Part 5.

George Holmes Howison highlights "final causation" in presenting his
theory of metaphysics, which he terms "personal idealism", and to
which he invites not only man, but all (ideal) life:

Here, in seeing that Final Cause – causation at the call of
self-posited aim or end – is the only full and genuine cause, we
further see that Nature, the cosmic aggregate of phenomena and the
cosmic bond of their law which in the mood of vague and inaccurate
abstraction we call Force, is after all only an effect... Thus
teleology, or the Reign of Final Cause, the reign of ideality, is not
only an element in the notion of Evolution, but is the very vital cord
in the notion. The conception of evolution is founded at last and
essentially in the conception of Progress: but this conception has no
meaning at all except in the light of a goal; there can be no goal
unless there is a Beyond for everything actual; and there is no such
Beyond except through a spontaneous ideal. The presupposition of
Nature, as a system undergoing evolution, is therefore the causal
activity of our Pure Ideals. These are our three organic and
organizing conceptions called the True, the Beautiful, and the Good.

— George Holmes Howison, The Limits of Evolution (1901)

However, Edward Feser argues, in line with the Aristotelian and
Thomistic tradition, that finality has been greatly
misunderstood. Indeed, without finality, efficient causality becomes
inexplicable. Finality thus understood is not purpose but that end
towards which a thing is ordered. When a match is rubbed against
the side of a matchbox, the effect is not the appearance of an
elephant or the sounding of a drum, but fire. The effect is not
arbitrary because the match is ordered towards the end of fire
which is realized through efficient causes.

In their biosemiotic study, Stuart Kauffman, Robert K. Logan et
al. (2007) remark:[34]

Our language is teleological. We believe that autonomous agents
constitute the minimal physical system to which teleological language
rightly applies.

"harrison-originalSin":
`
**The Reformers and Original Sin**

The fading fortunes of the Aristotelian understanding of causal order
extended not only to the powers of inanimate objects, but to human
powers and virtues as well. As we saw in the first chapter, virtues
were understood as habits that perfect natural powers. Natural powers,
in turn, move the entities in which they inhere—in this case human
persons—toward their natural ends. This was how Aristotelian “final
causes” were thought to operate.

The Protestant Reformers objected to
key elements of this conception of human habits and ends. For a start,
they took a much harder line than their scholastic predecessors on the
moral and cognitive incapacity that resulted from original sin.

One consequence of this uncompromising stance was a skepticism about
whether unaided human reason could penetrate to the essences of
things, or know about their true ends, or discern the intentions that
God might have had in creating natural things. These doubts, in turn,
were a motivating factor in a new experimental natural philosophy that
was more critical in its methods and more modest in its ambitions than
the Aristotelian natural philosophy that it was destined to
replace.

The Reformers, and Luther in particular, were also sharply
critical of the Aristotelian notion of __habitus__, because of its
perceived complicity in a mistaken view of justification, the doctrine
that explained how sinful human beings might be reconciled with
God. Not only were flawed human beings incapable of discerning their
true end, but even if they were, their weakened moral and intellectual
powers would be totally inadequate to move them in the right
direction.

These critical assaults, considered in more detail in the
next chapter, would necessitate a rethinking of the foundations of
Aristotelian moral philosophy, and of the role and operations of the
moral and intellectual virtues. As a consequence, _scientia_ and _religio_
will begin to assume the shape of the modern categories “science” and
“religion.”

"harrison-lostCauses":
`

Nehemiah Grew (1641-1712), a pioneer of plant physiology and active
early member of the Royal Society, made a point of excluding "Mystick,
Mytholo-gick, or Hieroglyphick matter" from his catalog of the Royal
Society's natural history collection. Instead, he would be focusing on
"the Uses and Reasons of Things." These were not deemed to have a proper
place in a legitimate natural history, These developments signal
the death of a universal hermeneutical framework in which the books of
scripture and nature were interpreted together.

Now, even the book of nature was subject to a plurality of
hermeneutical practices -- mathematical, anatomical, taxonomic. But the
collapse of the unified system of interpretation, and the separation
of the study of texts and the natural world, by no means implied that
the study of nature was to be pursued independently of theological
considerations. Instead a new partnership developed between theology
and the new science.

**Lost Causes**

Accompanying the evacuation of meaning from natural objects was the
stripping away of their intrinsic causal powers. The predominant
scholastic position on causal order was a "bottom up" understanding
that accounted for change in the world in terms of the inherent powers
and virtues of its con-stituents. This view derived ultimately from
Aristotle, for whom the powers of things derive from their forms. To
this basic Aristotelian conception the scholastics had added the idea
of a creator God, who is involved because he is responsible for the
being of those objects. Thus every event has a primary cause (God) and
a secondary cause (the powers of the individual agent). Some of the
later scholastics had already expressed reservations about this view
of things, but it was the advent of Descartes's new notion of laws of
nature that spelled the beginning of the end for intrinsic powers and
qualities.

For Descartes, as we have already seen, it is laws of
nature and not intrinsic properties that offer the best prospect for
explaining the operations of the natural world. These laws of nature
were not descriptive of relations among the properties of objects, but
rather of divine volitions.  On this "top down" understanding, the
regularities of nature were directly imposed upon it by God. Such a
view not only discounted the causal role of Aristotelian forms, but
ultimately led to doubts about whether there were any genuine
secondary causes in nature at all.

This tendency toward occasionalism - the idea that God is the only
true cause of natural events -- culminated in David Hume's (1711-76)
suggestion that causation was essentially psychological rather than
ontological, in human minds rather than the world.  Occasionalism
also fitted well with the idea of God promoted by the Protestant
Reformers, who emphasized the primacy of the divine will and stressed
God's omnipotence and transcendence.

Somewhat paradoxically, then, the pious idea that God was the only
genuine cause in the cosmos and that natural objects had no causal
powers of their own led to the direct equation of divine and natural
causality. For a number of key seventeenth-century natural
philosophers, and in particular the New-tonians, the regularities of
nature were a manifestation of the continuous and direct activity of
God.  The Newtonian philosopher-theologian Samuel

"hadot-philosophy-as-therapy":
`
**An interrupted dialogue with michel foucault: convergences and divergences**

in The Selected Writings of Pierre Hadot: Philosophy as Practice (Re-inventing Philosophy as a Way of Life) by Pierre Hadot

Curiously, Foucault, who gives so much place to the conception of
philosophy as therapy, does not seem to remark that this therapy is
aimed, above all, at procuring inner peace: that is to say, at
delivering the individual from the anxiety provoked by the
preoccupations of life and the mystery of human existence: the fear of
the gods and the terror of death. All the schools agree on the goal of
philosophy, to attain inner peace, even if they diverge when it comes
to setting the means to attain this goal. For the Sceptics, the
spiritual exercise par excellence is the suspension of judgement
(_epochê_); for the dogmatics–that is, all other ancient schools–one can
only accede to inner tranquillity by developing the awareness that one
is a ‘natural’ being, which is to say that one is, in some way, a part
of the cosmos, and that one participates in the event of universal
existence.

It is a matter of seeing things from the viewpoint of
universal nature, of putting human affairs in their true
perspective. In this way, one attains to greatness of soul, as Plato
had already said: The pettiness of mind is incompatible with the soul
which must tend continually to embrace the whole and the universality
of the divine and the human … Do you think that a soul habituated to
great thoughts and the contemplation of the totality of time and being
can deem this life of man a thing of great concern? Such a man will
not suppose death to be terrible or fearsome. 10”

"hadot-landscape":
`
**Charming Place, Sublime Landscape**

— The Selected Writings of Pierre Hadot: Philosophy as Practice
from Ancient Man and Nature, 56%, essay 8 


What are the characteristics of a ‘landscape’, in general terms? It
is, first of all, that which corresponds to a gaze focused
aesthetically, that is to say, disinterestedly upon nature. The field
or the stream becomes a ‘landscape’ when we look at them not as the
demarcations of frontiers, nor as a means of production or commerce
posing technical problems, but when we look at them for themselves,
without a practical finality. This gaze of the spectator carves out a
privileged field from the totality of nature. But it not only delimits
the landscape. It also unifies it, giving it a certain structure, and
organizes it.

This way of seeing perceives the landscape as a sort of
expressive physiognomy from which emanates a certain atmosphere,
sentiment or character. In this perception of what we could call a
corner of nature, in this portion it separates from the whole, this
gaze of the spectator simultaneously senses the totality of nature. In
other words, the landscape makes us sense our situation as terrestrial
beings.

As Carl Gustav Carus has said, the art of the landscape is the
art of representing the life of the earth (Erdlebendildkunst). 14
There is thus no landscape in itself, but solely in relation to a
spectator: in relation to the human being who knows how to see it, to
circumscribe it from the whole of nature in such a way as to, once
more, find this whole within the delimited, circumscribed space. This
is true in the art of landscape painting, in the literary description
of landscapes, but also in the perception of nature in general.

In other words, that which has been called a ‘landscape’ in painting or
in literature since the seventeenth century is nothing else, in life,
than the aesthetic perception of nature, the perception of the life of
the earth, as Carus puts it. And like art, such a perception supposes
a certain way of seeing.

One can distinguish two sorts of landscapes
in antiquity: the charming place (_locus amoenus_), and the grandiose or
sublime landscape.

The model of the charming landscape (locus
amoenus), which will dominate the imagination and sensibility of
antiquity, is the Cave of Calypso. 15 In the Homeric description, the
perceiving subject is the God Hermes, whose senses (of smell, hearing
and sight) are enchanted and whose soul is veritably ravished by his
contemplation of the beauty of the place. The components of the
charming place will always be woods of different kinds, birds,
meadows, murmuring springs, flowers, perfumes, the breeze, fruits: in
short, pleasures for all the senses. This whole will embody a divine
presence.

The theme can also be found in Sappho (in her ‘Prayer to
Aphrodite’), in Sophocles, 16 in the celebrated prologue of Plato’s
Phaedrus, in Theocritus (Thalysies), Lucretius, 17 Horace18 and
Quintilian. 19 If the ‘charming place’ is indisputably an object of
aesthetic contemplation in antiquity, can we say the same of those
grandiose or wild or terrifying spectacles that nature can offer to
man? Many historians have doubted this.

    - askesis: The Epicurean use of physics in this way offers us a
     good example of what Hadot refers to as “spiritual exercises”
     (áskēsis). While the term is familiar perhaps, from the title of
     Ignatius of Loyola’s well-known Exercitia spiritualia (1548)—a
     manual of contemplation, meditation, and self-review, set in the
     context of Catholic spirituality—Hadot argues that the expression
     is the best way to characterize the therapeutic philosophical
     practices of the Greco-Roman philosophical schools: “Each school
     had its own therapeutic method, but all of them linked their
     therapeutics to a profound transformation of the individual’s
     mode of seeing and being. The object of spiritual exercises is
     precisely to bring about this transformation.” 43 When Christian
     writers subsequently speak of exercises devoted to the
     cultivation or cure of the soul, they are simply carrying over
     this classical idea. To take just one example, Ambrose of Milan
     (ca. AD 340–97), one of the great doctors of the Western church,
     stated that “fortitude of the soul is enhanced by a course of
     exercises.” These exercises consisted in prayer, meditation, and
     the reading of scripture. 44

    - "nation", Ernest Renan: The nineteenth-century French scholar,
  (1823–92), while probably best known for his popular and
  controversial Life of Jesus (1863), also penned the classic essay
  “What Is a Nation?” (1882). Here, he offers this telling remark:
  “Forgetting—I would go so far as to say historical error—is a
  crucial factor in the creation of a nation.” 55 The specific case
  that Renan had in mind was the reified object “la France.” France,
  he suggests, invented nationhood, and all other models of the nation
  were henceforth regarded as inferior imitations. But the very idea
  of France required the jettisoning of a burden of unwelcome
  historical truths. While we are all aware of the manner in which the
  idea of a nation involves founding myths of various kinds, and
  through them, the positive construction of a particular ideal, we
  are here reminded that founding myths also require a kind of
  negation—an amnesia about what came before, and a forgetting of
  historical realities that might challenge the integrity of our new
  conception.

    - "nation", Karl Deutsch’s similarly unflattering definition
  “a group of people united by a mistaken view about the
  past and a hatred of their neighbours”  is not an altogether
  unfitting description for those who in recent times have sought to
  foment hostility between science and religion.  This first chapter
  has provided some reasons for thinking that the creation of the
  modern boundaries of these concepts has also been accompanied by a
  kind of historical amnesia. In the chapters to come, I hope to
  expose some of the myths that inform our present categories, and to
  offer further details of an alternative, and largely forgotten
  history—a history that, once called to mind, may help us reconfigure
  the relationship between the entities that we now call “science” and
  “religion.”

"askesis":

__Sunlight and water<br>
Leaf and lung<br>
Story, branch<br>
Wing and bone__


These words, and spəquabs - has a fat nose - are instruments in my
askesis, spiritual (I suppose) exercises to orient myself.

Like my orthodox Jewish neighbors, yarmulke’d reading the Torah as
they walk on the sidewalk to temple on the sabbath.

(The influences of the modern project, the human career will otherwise insinuate, take over)

I elaborate, develop these here, useful to me, maybe to you

I won’t work in order.

I will start with lung.

**Askēsis**

There are several overlapping meanings of this Greek word, the base shared meaning is "exercise".

The sense I intend is "self-formation", akin to Foucault's "technologies of self" and "care of the self",
and similar in purpose to the Spiritual Exercises of 16th century Ignatius of Loyola.  These are all
programs to redirect one's attention, to facilitate entry into a composed, non-default world view.

Of Foulcault: 

<blockquote>

In his renowned courses at the Collège de France from 1982 to 1984,
Michel Foucault devoted his lectures to meticulous readings and
interpretations of the works of Plato, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus
Aurelius, among others. In this his aim was not, Edward F. McGushin
contends, to develop a new knowledge of the history of philosophy;
rather, it was to let himself be transformed by the very activity of
thinking. Thus, this work shows us Foucault in the last phase of his
life in the act of becoming a philosopher. Here we see how his
encounter with ancient philosophy allowed him to experience the
practice of philosophy as, to paraphrase Nietzsche, a way of becoming
who one is: the work of self-formation that the Greeks called askēsis.

<p>
Through a detailed study of Foucault's last courses, McGushin
demonstrates that this new way of practicing philosophical askēsis
evokes Foucault's ethical resistance to modern relations of power and
knowledge. In order to understand Foucault's later project, then, it
is necessary to see it within the context of his earlier work. If his
earlier projects represented an attempt to bring to light the
relations of power and knowledge that narrowed and limited freedom,
then this last project represents his effort to take back that freedom
by redefining it in terms of care of the self. Foucault always
stressed that modern power functions by producing individual
subjects. This book shows how his excavation of ancient philosophical
practices gave him the tools to counter this function-with a practice
of self-formation, an askēsis.

</blockquote>

Four definitions: 
- Athletic training: The word originated in the context of Olympic athletics. 
- Asceticism: The word later came to refer to the self-discipline and practices of early Christianity and other major religions. 
- Self-formation: The practice of self-formation is also known as askēsis. 
- Cynic training: Cynics trained their bodies for the sake of their souls, through practices such as walking barefoot in the snow.

**Charles Taylor's Romanticism Project**

In my earlier book, The Language Animal, I tried to work out the
relevance today of the theory of language which was developed among
the German Romantics in the 1790s. In this book, I want to explore
the understanding of poetics which was implicit in (indeed, central
to) this theory of language, and then see some of the consequences
which flowed from this in the poetry of the last two centuries.

The new thinking of the 1790s was framed in two registers, as it
were, philosophy on one hand, and new understandings of poetry, on the
other. Moreover, although poets and philosophers were in close contact
and exchange, they ended up having a rather different take on this
complex of ideas, so it might help to explicate separately what came
from the two sources.

The thinkers of the Romantic generation were a
very diverse lot, and had a lot of quarrels and disagreements, but
there were common themes and notions. I will try to set out their
philosophical outlook, but this will be my reconstruction, which I
hope captures its general shape and spirit. I will do this, with
perhaps unbearable terseness, in seven interlocking theses.

**1. A Spinoza-derived pantheism**

Inspired by Goethe, they embraced a Spinoza-derived
pantheism. (Literal readers of Spinoza might be horrified because this
vision completely separated the seventeenth-century thinker from his
Cartesian roots.) Nature was not to be understood mechanistically. It
was more like a living organism. In other words, the Romantics were
rebelling against a dead, mechanical view of Nature. And they were
also rebelling against mind-body dualism, and against a purely
instrumental approach to nature. They rejected the one-sided emphasis
on (a) the modes of discipline controlling impulses, particularly
erotic; especially (b) disciplines aimed exclusively at efficacious
control over the environment. They also wanted to dissipate (c) guilt
over disturbing, especially erotic, impulses which upset (a) and
(b). They longed for a unification of self, unity with our emotions,
with nature in us, and with nature as a whole.

In this regard, one of
their primary sources of inspiration was Goethe (who was nevertheless
uncomfortable with their more rebellious stances).

**2. Our soul communicates with this whole.**

Nature resonates in us, and we intensify this through expression, art.

**3. But our whole idea of Nature has undergone a modern shift.**

It isn’t just a static set, or
ordered cosmos, of beautiful forms; rather it is striving, developing;
Nature is producing higher and higher forms. Spinoza’s natura naturans
[nature doing as nature does] is seen as in motion, unfolding, seeking
its adequate form.

**4. Moreover, this is what we also are doing.**

We are striving to discover our true form through creative expression,
moving stage by stage. This type of development might be called
“expressive-historical”: at each stage we try to realize, that is,
give expression to our potential; and this realization makes manifest
how we fall short, and what further changes are necessary. Indeed, it
is this new anthropology of serial self-discovery which lies behind
the new view of nature as development (and perhaps vice versa).

**5.  The two lines of expressive-historical development, of the cosmos and humans, respectively, are interlinked.**

Nature or cosmos can’t reach its final form without our realizing
ours. That is because the successive stages of the cosmos need
continually advancing consciousness, of which humans are the
locus. This shows that our “normal,” common sense of our predicament,
the notion that the human subject stands apart from, and over against,
the world of nature, is only part of the truth. On a deeper level, we
discover that Nature is not static, but comes to its fullest
realization along with, and through, our own self-realization as
rational and free beings. This opens a new path to discovery; not just
that of external observation, which issues in science, but also that
of internal exploration (see Novalis). There is an important path to
truth through the articulation of personal experience, of our
emotions, which we explore through art, or poetry in the widest
sense. In this search, imagination plays a crucial role.

**6. Freedom**

This notion of expression connects up to a new ideal of (6) freedom,
as full self-realization; this goes beyond the notion of negative
freedom, freedom from, which is one of the prominent modern
understandings of the concept. It also includes, while going beyond,
the new understanding of freedom as autonomy, which was both an
ethical and political ideal. Kant is the great articulator of this
ideal, followed by Fichte. But within the new anthropology of humans
as self-developing, autonomy has to include full self-realization.

Points (3) and (4), together with (5) and (6), suggest

**7. the ideal of the perfect reconciling of freedom and unity with nature, within and without.**

The progress to this is then envisaged through a
narrative of history, the so-called exzentrische Bahn [spiral path],
whereby we leave an initial state of harmonious unity between humans
and nature, pass through a period of their opposition, as we develop
our reason and increase our autonomy, to return to a higher
unity. (This goal was often tersely defined as combining Fichte and
Spinoza.) Hölderlin makes this point in his Hyperion Fragment, as does
Schiller in his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man.

**8. Irony**

But is the end attainable? Perhaps not. This gives a place to (8)
Irony: the road to (7) may never be completed; we may always strive,
suffer distance. Ironic expression, however, manifests the gap, and
shows what we strive for. There is one vision, espoused by some in
the generation of the 1790s, which looks forward to no fully
satisfactory end, but expects (and even rejoices in) perpetual
challenge and change.

So we develop as Nature develops, and indeed, our proper development
matches that of nature, brings it to consciousness, and unites it with
freedom. In fact, as we saw, we partake in the development of nature,
which requires conscious expression to realize its end. We are the
locus where Nature becomes aware of itself. Many of the writers of the
1790s shared the view, later articulated by Schelling (and in a more
rationalist form by Hegel), that the full realization of Nature
requires the conscious expression which only Spirit can give it. Art
(or philosophy) and Nature come into unison because they come to
fulfillment together.

We find our own goals in Nature, which must thus be correctly
read. But since our spiral path has taken us away from the immediate
unity with nature, we can no longer read it easily. What Romantic art,
Poetry, strives to do is recover an adequate reading, and this would
of necessity mean the creation of a mode of symbolic access.

But before I explain this term, we should be clear that this whole
spiral path was not yet seen as completed. The final reconciling steps
were still a forward-looking agenda.

Before we examine this, let us look at the other sources of ideas
which circulated among these thinkers.5

  contemporary physics points towards their restoration and to nature

an excerpt

    —And I have felt
A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br>
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br>
Of something far more deeply interfused,<br>
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br>
And the round ocean and the living air,<br>
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:<br>
A motion and a spirit, that impels<br>
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br>
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still<br>
A lover of the meadows and the woods<br>
And mountains; and of all that we behold<br>
From this green earth; of all the mighty world<br>
Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create,<br>
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise<br>
In nature and the language of the sense<br>
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br>
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br>
Of all my moral being.<br>

Set this side by side with Kenneth Rexroths Signature
of all Things, which concludes

When I dragged the rotten log<br>
From the bottom of the pool,<br>
It seemed heavy as stone.<br>
I let it lie in the sun<br>
For a month; and then chopped it<br>
Into sections, and split them<br>
For kindling, and spread them out<br>
To dry some more. Late that night;<br>
After reading for hours,<br>
While moths rattled at the lamp,<br>
The saints and the philosophers<br>
On the destiny of man;<br>
I went out on my cabin porch,<br>
And looked up through the black forest<br>
At the swaying islands of stars.<br>
Suddenly I saw at my feet,<br>
Spread on the floor of night, ingots<br>
Of quivering phosphorescence,<br>
And all about were scattered chips<br>
Of pale cold light that was alive.<br>

My aim is to find works and practices that foster this connection,
backed up by the biology and biochemistry of photosynthesis, electron
flow, the eucaryotic cell.  spəquabs old-growth.

but now: ride down to the woods.

and now, back from the woods.

Animism confers personhood on non humans.   My drift is to confer (perceive)
creature-hood in myself.

de Viveiros Castro: Cannibal Metaphysics, multinaturalism (?), the
spanish/indian inverted tests for same body/same mind.
Descola and the Achuar: hunters's metaphysics, their wives manioc animism.

leaving most of us with supermarket metaphysics: non-humans are but entities
bought and sold at the local market.  complemented by supernatural metaphysics:
I remember entering the interstate in Phoenix, morning rush hour traffic,
thinking "If I lived here I'd probably believe in Jesus also".

and my own spəquabs solution:
  use sunlight & water, leaf & lung, language wing and bone
the immediate lively experience, all in the frame of fertiale planet history,
electron transport chain with membranes. the career of water, the career of
electron-packed carbon chains.

"hermetic-signatures":
`
[from Charles Taylor, Cosmic Connection: Poetry in the Age of Disenchantment,
chapter 1?]

Another influential source of ideas of order and affinity between
things during the Renaissance was the Hermetic tradition, supposedly
based on the thought of Hermes Trismegistus, an ancient Egyptian
sage. Celestial bodies influence things on earth, and there exist
relations of sympathy between the macrocosm and the human microcosm,
and between heavenly and earthly beings.

We can trace these links by recognizing the “signatures” in material
things which are marks of the heavenly bodies, according to the
theories of Paracelsus.

The seventeenth-century mystic Jakob Böhme
took over this term and saw “signatures” in things as the key to
reading the Natursprache [the speech of nature]: the language in which
Adam had named the animals and other creatures at the beginning.

Reading beside the waterfall –<br>
Boehme's 'Signature of all Things.'<br>
Through the deep July day the leaves<br>
Of the laurel, all the colors<br>
Of gold, spin down through the moving<br>
Deep laurel shade all day. They float<br>
On the mirrored sky and forest<br>
For a while, and then, still slowly<br>
Spinning, sink through the crystal deep<br>
Of the pool to its leaf gold floor.<br>
The saint saw the world as streaming<br>
In the electrolysis of love.<br>
I put him by and gaze through shade<br>
Folded into shade of slender<br>
Laurel trunks and leaves filled with sun.<br>
The wren broods in her moss domed nest.<br>
A newt struggles with a white moth<br>
Drowning in the pool. The hawks scream,<br>
Playing together on the ceiling<br>
Of heaven. The long hours go by.<br>
I think of those who have loved me,<br>
Of all the mountains I have climbed,<br>
Of all the seas I have swum in.<br>
The evil of the world sinks.<br>
My own sin and trouble fall away<br>
Like Christian's bundle, and I watch<br>
My forty summers fall like falling<br>
Leaves and falling water held<br>
Eternally in summer air.<br>

Deer are stamping in the glades,<br>
Under the full July moon.<br>
There is a smell of dry grass<br>
In the air, and more faintly,<br>
The scent of a far off skunk.<br>
As I stand at the wood's edge,<br>
Watching the darkness, listening<br>
To the stillness, a small owl<br>
Comes to the branch above me,<br>
On wings more still than my breath.<br>
When I turn my light on him,<br>
His eyes glow like drops of iron,<br>
And he perks his head at me,<br>
Like a curious kitten.<br>
The meadow is bright as snow.<br>
My dog prows the grass, a dark<br>
Blur in the blur of brightness<br>
I walk to the oak grove where<br>
The Indian village was once.<br>
There, in blotched and cobwebbed light<br>
And dark, dim in the blue haze,<br>
Are twenty Holstein heifers,<br>
Black and white, all lying down,<br>
Quietly together, under<br>
The huge trees rooted in the graves.<br>

**Cosmic Orders**

[from Charles Taylor, Cosmic Connection: Poetry in the Age of Disenchantment,
chapter 1, 1%]

Medieval and Renaissance Language of Insight. Terms weren’t just
arbitrarily applied to what they designate but would be somehow
uniquely right or appropriate to the things they named, 
satisfying the demands of Plato’s Cratylus: a word would figure what it
designates, show something of the inherent nature of the
object. (In this middle period dialog, Socrates is asked by two men,
Cratylus and Hermogenes, to tell them whether names are
"conventional" or "natural".)

The basic feature of this scheme, that the cosmos is the realization
of a plan, which one already sees in Plato,
is the notion of a self-realizing order. This is what Plato presents
in the Republic: the things we see about us in the world are in each
case striving to realize the Idea or archetype to which they belong;
and the cosmic order in which these things have their place is
itself given its shape by the architectonic Idea, that of the
Good.

Following Plato himself in the Timaeus, this was taken up by
Christian theology, with the Ideas being the thoughts of God that he
carries into effect in creating the world. In either variant, the
cosmos and all it contains is to be understood as the realization of
a plan which presides over its unfolding.

This basic scheme was carried forward into Neoplatonism, but here the
unfolding plan was understood as a kind of emanation from the One,
rather than a creation ex nihilo.

**Romantic Dual-Language Thesis**

[from Charles Taylor, Cosmic Connection: Poetry in the Age of Disenchantment,
chapter 1, 2%]

[The Romantics] didn’t simply reject the modern understanding of
language, as an instrument whereby we encode and communicate
information, and in the process increase our control over nature.

Rather they espoused what I want to call the “dual-language thesis.”

Language can be simply an instrument to encode information, describing
the reality which already lies open before us, and communicating the
information to others. But there are levels of language which do
something much more, where our expressions bring about the
revelation-and-connection the language of insight yields: the language of
insight, "subtler languages".

This distinction between a higher, creative and a lower, merely
instrumental language is one of the continuing legacies of the
Romantic period. The Romantic theory applies to this higher level; it
doesn’t describe the whole.

**The Annotated Forest**

wednesday 2 october

martin gardner's "the annotated alice" includes all of lewis carroll's
Alice in wonderland, with many a comment added, to enrich the reading:
from wikipedia:

   The Annotated Alice is a 1960 book by Martin Gardner incorporating the
   text of Lewis Carroll's major tales, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
   (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871), as well as the original
   illustrations by John Tenniel. It has extensive annotations explaining
   the contemporary references (including the Victorian poems that
   Carroll parodies), mathematical concepts, word play, and Victorian
   traditions (such as the parlor game snap-dragons) featured in the two
   books.

i offer here some annotations on a forest i know.  it lies down the
hill from my home, 120 acres on a peninsula, in a lake 20 miles long
and a mile wide, lying rougly north-south, spanned by two bridges,
the city of seattle to the west, bellevue to the east: a city park
populated with self-managing old-growth forest, centuries old.

it is a popular place.  you step into it and the city drops away.
storied undergrowth, towering doug fir, cedar and maple, meandering
paths, one of them quite broad and sort of straight, many others
narrow and twisting.

its enough to walk here: it will change your mind.  rather than seeing
straight paved roads, right angles, flat surfaces, wires on poles,
cars driven fast, people in a hurry:   shapes grown, branches graceful
and long, interwoven, never colliding, geometries of elegance as this
assemblage, each member in its own way, at its own level, reaching for
the sun.  dappled sunlight sprinkled on the ground on sunny days, grey
skies often in the winter.

so why annotate?  if, as I claim, it is enough to walk here, to have
one's enviroment-determined mind changed by immersion, what more do
you want?  and are there not perils to adding explanations to features
of this welcoming place, explanations which come from analysis, and
thus prone to put me in a frame of mind the opposite of the immersive
one, that of (as some call it) forest bathing?

there IS that danger.

But there is also narrative beauty and elegance revealed from such
notes, annotations, explanations and stories.  When pursued with care
these two modes, these two kinds of experience can feed each other.

One quick example.  see the large bigleaf maple standing there beside the
trail.  see that particularly audacious limb extending 100 feet to the
southwest. it is going somewhere.  trace  that going from the
maple's main trunk, along the principal branch - ignoring for now its
smaller side branches.  that principal branch - its going has taken it
into a spot where the canopy is open.   clearings like this do not
occur often in this forest.  here, sometime in the last 50 years, a
doug fir came down, and the sky was left open.  this branch, its
going, sensed that opening, and year by year grew towards it, now
spreading its bigleaf leaves to catch the sunlight.

There is no explicit molecular biology - not yet - in this note, in
this story, inferred, reconstructed from the present shape of this
large audacious branch.  some of that will come later.   this story,
when I tell it, when I remind myself of it, when I focus on this sort
of thing, brings the forest (for me, for some of my listeners) to
life.  a history is had.  the tree has goals which we can read off the
forest, on days when we are so inclinded.  direct sunlight, or
incrementally stronger indirect sunlight, is detected, growth hormones
marshalled, water and last year's stored sugar bargained for: then in
early spring the branch grows.

Having a nose for sunlight is the thing.  like evolution, it likely
does not look ahead, it's more of a moment by moment calculation, an
experiment, detecting and exploiting possibilities.

some branches are failed experiments.  you see them as leafless, or
after a few years, as broken stubs.  they had a promising start, but
their gamble failed.  they used resources from the whole tree, then
for a while made and contributed back some portion of its food sugar
to the tree.  but the economics, the tree's notion of supply and
demand, of reciprocal exchange for the betterment of all - those
economics did not pan out.  so some combination of the branch's
independt failure to capture much sunlight, and (in some trees) the
whole tree's calculation that the branch was a bad bet, and the branch
died on its own or was (at least in part), saw its water, growth
hormones, minerals of early-spring supply of stored sugar, and the
branch senesced, failed, eventually now or soon enough, breaking off
at the trunk.  

The shape of the tree then tells the story of its lifetime of
searching for, finding and capturing sunlight.  Intricate flows,
complex calculations, sturdy outreach and growth.

Rosh Hashanah (literally 'head of the year') is the New Year in
Judaism. The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah (lit. 'day
of shouting/blasting'). It is the first of the High Holy Days as
specified by Leviticus 23:23–25, that occur in the late
summer/early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere. Rosh Hashanah begins
ten days of penitence culminating in Yom Kippur, as well as beginning
the cycle of autumnal religious festivals running through Sukkot which
end on Shemini Atzeret in Israel and Simchat Torah everywhere else.

Feeling out of sorts - why?.  Some factors: sore hip not responding to
my remedies; threat of 12 years of Trump/Vance after vp debate this
week; Tlingit slexil vacuum after Sharing Our Knowledge Conference in
Sitka; maybe after effects of some (painful but fruitful, worthy)
drama with Amy.

A familiar remedy, which so easily slips away:  hop out of the human-centered
story line, into the deeper richer eucaryotic cell narrative.

Where anthropocentrism is an ideology:

<blockquote>
  Ideology is a representation of the imaginary relationship of
  individuals to their real conditions of existence.
</blockquote>

In Althusser's scientific Marxism, the real conditions of existence
cannot be directly known because of language (its opacity?).  See
Jameson and Lacan on this also.  Quoting from Purdue: however, through
a rigorous"scientific" approach to society, economics, and history, we
can come close to perceiving if not those "Real conditions" at least
the ways that we are inscribed in ideology by complex processes of
recognition.

Seen this morning, the first day of Rosh Hashanah, near the start of my
therapeutic walk to spəqabs: an orthodox man with yarmulke reading
scripture as he walked.  Foucault's technology of self in action.

Might I do the same?  See through my default ideology, cultivate the fertile eucaryote story,
powered by mitochondrial and chloroplast symbioses, stabilized by many smaller mutualisms
throughout this large family.

Thus the better story is a family portrait: all of us built from these ever-adaptable cells,
growing out a lively planet.

   target="_blank"> Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics (pdf)</a>

by Graham Harman.

**p25**

Like the works of Whitehead, Nietzsche, or Leibniz, Irreductions views
objects as individual perspectives on the rest. 'Every actant makes a
whole world for itself. Who are we? What can we know? What can we hope
for?

The answers to these pompous questions define and modify their shapes
and boundaries' (PF, p. 192). Needless to say, for Latour these
questions are asked by coal and tar no less than by enlightened
humans. Stated more poetically:

I don't know how things stand. I know neither who I am nor what I
want, but others say they know on my behalf, others, who define me,
link me up, make me speak, interpret what I say, and enroll
me. Whether I am a storm, a rat, a rock, a lake, a lion, a child, a
worker, a gene, a slave, the unconscious, or a virus, they whisper to
me, they suggest, they impose an interpretation of what I am and what
I could be (PF, p. 192).

No Copernican philosopher, whether analytic or continental, could
write such a paragraph. This brief passage runs counter to all that is
assumed by Husserl, Heidegger, Derrida, Russell, or Quine. The absence
of rats, lions, and lakes from mainstream philosophical debate speaks
not against Bruno Latour, but against the bland default metaphysics
that reduces objects to our human access to them.

**p12**

Late in 1972, a remarkable young thinker was driving his Citroën van
along the highways of Burgundy. Only twenty-five years old, already
married, he was teaching at a village lycée and preparing for national
service in Africa. In one respect the young philosopher was an
outsider, emerging from remote Dijon rather than the elite
institutions of Paris. Yet this provincial outlier had also ranked
first nationally in the Agrégation, a stunning success that must have
felt like a license to speculate as freely as he wished. Too little
has been written about dramatic flashes of insight in the history of
philoso-phy. We know of Descartes's dreams and his stove-heated room,
Rousseau weeping under a tree, and Avicenna saying prayers and giving
money to the poor after reading Farabi's commentary on Aristotle. But
we are unfamiliar with the breakthrough moments of Heidegger, Kant,
Leibniz, or Plato, though we know these moments well for every Zen
monk worth his salt.

In Irreductions, Latour joins the minority by publishing his own
moment of epiphany: 'I taught at Gray in the French provinces for a
year. At the end of the winter of 1972, on the road from Dijon to
Gray, I was forced to stop, brought to my senses after an overdose of
reductionism' (PF, p. 162). There follows a Homeric catalog of various
humans who like to reduce the world to some special reality that
explains all the others: Christians, Catholics, as-tronomers,
mathematicians, philosophers, Hegelians, Kantians, engineers,
administrators, intellectuals, bourgeoisie, Westerners, writers,
painters, se-mioticians, males, militants, and alchemists. All these
reducers had finally managed to repel the young Latour, who sat on the
roadside dreaming of a new principle of philosophy:

<blockquote>

I knew nothing,
then, of what I am writing now but simply repeated to myself: 'Nothing
can be reduced to anything else, nothing can be deduced from anything
else, everything may be allied to everything else'.  This was like an
exorcism that defeated demons one by one. It was a wintry sky, and a
very blue. I no longer needed to prop it up with a cosmolo-gy, put it
in a picture, render it in writing, measure it in a meteorological
article, or place it on a Titan to prevent it falling on my head
[...]. It and me, them and us, we mutually defined ourselves. And for
the first time in my life I saw things unreduced and set free (PF,
p. 163).

</blockquote>

An entire philosophy is foreshadowed in this anecdote. Every human and
nonhuman object now stands by itself as a force to reckon with. No
actor, however trivial, will be dismissed as mere noise in comparison
with its es-sence, its context, its physical body, or its conditions
of possibility. Everything will be absolutely concrete; all objects
and all modes of dealing with objects will now be on the same
footing. In Latour's new and unreduced cosmos, philosophy and physics
both come to grips with forces in the world, but so do generals,
surgeons, nannies, writers, chefs, biologists, aeronautical
engi-neers, and seducers (PF, pp. 154-6).

And though all these
examples of actors are human, they are no different in kind from the
forces that draw objects to the center of the earth or repress desires
in the unconscious. The world is a series of negotiations between a
motley armada of forces, humans among them, and such a world cannot be
divided cleanly between two pre-existent poles called 'nature' and
'society'.

As Latour puts it: 'we do not know what forces there are, nor their balance. We do
not want to reduce anything to anything else [...]. What happens when
nothing is reduced to anything else?  What happens when we suspend our
knowledge of what a force is? What happens when we do not know how
their way of relating to one another is forever changing?' (PF,
pp. 156-7). What happens is the birth of an object-oriented
philosophy.

Latour always insists that we cannot philosophize from
raw first principles but must follow objects in action and describe
what we see. Empirical studies are more important for him than for
almost any other philosopher; later in his career, he will even speak
of an 'experimental metaphysics' (PN, pp. 123, 241-2). Nonetheless,
there are a small number of basic principles that guide his vast
empirical labours. In Irreductions, Latour's first philosophical
treatise, there seem to be four central ideas from which the others
blossom.

First, the world is made up of actors or actants (which I will also
call 'ob-jects'). Atoms and molecules are actants, as are children,
raindrops, bullet trains, politicians, and numerals. All entities are
on exactly the same ontological footing. An atom is no more real than
Deutsche Bank or the 1976 Winter Olympics, even if one is likely to
endure much longer than the oth-ers. This principle ends the classical
distinction between natural substance and artificial aggregate
proposed most candidly by Leibniz. It also ends the tear-jerking
modern rift between the thinking human subject and the unknowable
outside world, since for Latour the isolated Kantian human is no more
and no less an actor than are windmills, sunflowers, propane tanks,
and Thailand. Finally, it shows the deep ambivalence of Latour's
relationship with Aristotle. For in one sense, Latour joins Aristotle
in insisting that what is real are only concrete entities. The
billions of cats in the world are real individuals, not a single
cat-form stamped in despicable clots of corrupt physical matter. But
in another sense, Latour takes concreteness in a more radical
direction than Aristotle would permit. For Aristotle, individuals are
substances—and substances are deeper than their accidents and their
relations to other things, and capable of enduring despite changes in
these inessential features. For Latour, by contrast, an actant is not
a privileged inner kernel encrusted with peripheral accidents and
relations. After all, this would make a thing's surface derivative of
its depth, thereby spoiling the principle of irreduction. There cannot
be an essential Socrates hiding behind the Socrates who happens to be
speaking and wearing white at this very moment. For Latour, a thing is
so utterly concrete that none of its features can be scraped away like
cobwebs or moss. All features belong to the actor itself: a force
utterly deployed in the world at any given moment, entirely
characterized by its full set of features.

Second, there is the principle of irreduction itself. No object is
inherently reducible or irreducible to any other. In one sense we can
never explain religion as the result of social factors, World War I as
the result of rail timetables,or the complex motion of bodies as pure
examples of Newtonian physics. Yet in another sense we can always
attempt such explanations, and sometimes they are fairly
convincing. It is always possible to explain anything in terms of
anything else as long as we do the work of showing how one can be
transformed into the other, through a chain of equivalences that
always has a price and always risks failure.

Third, the means of linking one thing with another is
translation. When Stalin and Zhukov order the encircling movement at
Stalingrad, this is not a pure dictate trumpeted through space and
transparently obeyed by the participant actors. Instead, a massive
work of mediation occurs. Staff officers draw up detailed plans with
large-scale maps that are then translated into individual platoon
orders at the local level; officers then relay the or-ders, each
making use of his own rhetorical style and personal rapport with the
soldiers; finally, each individual soldier has to move his arms and
legs independently to give final translation to the orders from
above. Surprising obstacles arise, and some orders need to be
improvised the enemy melts away at unexpected points but puts up
stubborn resistance in equally startling places. Moving from war to
logic, we find that even logical deductions do not move at the speed
of light. Deductions too are transformed one step at a time through
different layers of concepts, adjusting themselves to local conditions
at each step, deciding at each step where the force of the deduction
lies and where possible variations can be addressed or ignored. No
layer of the world is a transparent intermediary, since each is a
medium: or in Latour's preferred term, a mediator. A mediator is not
some sycophantic eunuch fanning its masters with palm-leaves, but
always does new work of its own to shape the translation of forces
from one point of reality to the next.  Here as elsewhere, Latour's
guiding maxim is to grant dignity even to the least grain of
reality. Nothing is mere rubble to be used up or trampled by mightier
actors. Nothing is a mere intermediary. Mediators speak, and other
mediators resist.

Fourth, actants are not stronger or weaker by virtue of some inherent
strength or weakness harbored all along in their private
essence. Instead, actants gain in strength only through their
alliances. As long as no one reads Mendel's papers, his breakthroughs
in genetics remain weak. An airplane crashes if a few hydraulic lines
malfunction, but the resistance of these lines is weakened in turn if
they are discovered and exiled to a garbage dump.  For Latour, an
object is neither a substance nor an essence, but an actor trying to
adjust or inflict its forces, not unlike Nietzsche's cosmic vision of
the will to power.

Although Latour generally opposes reducing multiplicities to simple
explanatory structures, his four metaphysical axioms all stem from a
deeper principle: absolute concreteness. Every actant simply is what
it is. This entails that all actants are on the same footing: both
large and small, both human and nonhuman. No actant is just fodder for
others; each enhances and resists the others in highly specific
ways. Since every actant is entirely concrete, we do not find its
reality in some lonely essence or chaste substrate, but always in an
absolutely specific place in the world, with completely specific
alliances at any given moment. Everything is immanent in the world;
nothing transcends actuality. In other words, Latour is proudly guilty
of what Roy Bhaskar and Manuel DeLanda both call 'actualism'. For
Latour the world is a field of objects or actants locked in trials of
strength-some growing stronger through increased associations, others
becoming weaker and lonelier as they are cut off from others.

Latour's difference from present-day analytic and continental thought
should now be clear. Whereas Latour places all human, nonhuman,
natu-ral, and artificial objects on the same footing, the analytics
and continentals both still dither over how to bridge, ignore, deny,
or explain away a single gap between humans and world. While graduate
students are usually drilled in a stale dispute between correspondence
and coherence theories of truth, Latour locates truth in neither of
these models, but in a series of translations between actors. And
whereas mainstream philosophy worries about whether things exist
independently of us or are constructed by the mind, Latour says they
are 'socially' constructed not just by human minds, but also by
bodies, atoms, cosmic rays, business lunches, rumors, physical force,
propa-ganda, or God. There is no privileged force to which the others
can be re-duced, and certainly no ceaseless interplay between pure
natural forces and pure social forces, each untainted by the
other. Nothing exists but actants, and all of them are utterly
concrete.

"neofinalism":
`
source: Introduction by Mark Hansen to NeoFinalism


The publication of the English translation
of Ruyer’s masterpiece, Neo-Finalisme (1952), will make a crucial
contribution to recent activity aimed at redirecting attention to this
unduly neglected twentieth-century philosopher. The critical neglect
of Ruyer’s thought is by no means exclusive to English-language
circles, whose exposure has until now been limited to a few articles
published in the interdisciplinary philosophy journal Diogenes.2
Indeed, as Fabrice Colonna observes in his editorial presentation for
a special issue of the French journal Les Études philosophiques,
devoted to Ruyer, “the fact is that Ruyer has been purely and simply
effaced from the field of theoretical references.”3 This fact is all
the more unfortunate given the manifold resonances that link Ruyer’s
philosophical corpus to key concerns of contemporary philosophy and
cultural theory in both English- and French-language circles,
including such hot-button issues as the mind–body problem or the
presuppositions behind biological morphogenesis.

More than any other factor, it is Ruyer's attitude towards science
that ultimately account for whatever impact his work will have on
contemporary intellectual debates. Like William James and Alfred North
Whitehead, both of whom are currently undergoing revitalizations of
their own, and like his compatriot Gilbert Simondon, whose work has
for some time now garnered critical attention and respect, Ruyer is a
philosopher who not only deeply respects the work of scientists but
believes at heart that his own work bears a crucial responsibility to
science. The ultimate aim of Ruyer’s philosophy is precisely to
provide the metaphysical basis on which the empirical findings of
scientific research can be made to cohere.

The “Duality” of Mind and Appearance

This attitude is clearly manifest almost from the very outset of
Ruyer’s career. One could argue that Ruyer’s break with his own
initial devotion to structuralism—a devotion that finds quintessential
expression in his primary thesis (Esquisse d’une philosophie de la
structure)—represents the single most consequential development of his
entire philosophical career. For it is this break, and the
differentiation of functioning (fonctionnement) from structure, that
informs Ruyer’s later theorization of a “transspatial” domain of form
that lies beneath and in-forms what happens in space and time. As we
shall see, this key insight stems from Ruyer’s philosophical
working-through of scientific research, in this case, in the
burgeoning field of embryology: not only does Ruyer aim to explain how
the embryo holds the potential for the future development of an
organism but he seeks to develop the process of embryogenesis into a
philosophical model for the operation of form as such.

<blockquote>
 Philosophy has a duty to avoid snobbery, but also not to fall prey to timidity.
 Raymond Ruyer, “L’esprit philosophique”
 </blockquote>


Raymond Ruyer (1902–87) was born in Plainfaing in the Department of
Vosges in the Lorraine region of northeastern France. A precocious
student who at nineteen received a first on his college entrance exam,
Ruyer pursued a course of study in philosophy at the prestigious École
Normale Supérieure and aggregated in 1924.

While teaching at the lycée
of Saint-Brieuc, Ruyer published his two theses, Esquisse d’une
philosophie de la structure (Outline of a philosophy of structure) and
L’Humanité de l’avenir d’après Cournot (Humanity of the future
according to Cournot). In 1934, he returned to the Vosges region,
taking up a position at the University of Nancy, where he was
subsequently appointed maître de conférences (1939) and professor
(following the war).

From 1940 to 1945, Ruyer was a prisoner of war in
a camp for French soldiers in Edelbach, Austria, where he participated
in a vibrant intellectual culture with a number of scholars, including
the biologist Étienne Wolff and the geologist François Ellenberger,
both of whom would go on to prominence. It was during this time of
internment that Ruyer wrote what would become the first exposé of his
mature system, Éléments de psycho-biologie (Elements of psychobiology;
published in 1946).

After the war, Ruyer would go on to a solid
university career as professor of philosophy at the University of
Nancy. Author of twenty-two books and more than one hundred articles,
Ruyer fully embraced his penchant for philosophy of the esprit
métaphysique, by which he meant philosophy in its “proper form,”
philosophy that “is interested” not only in “everything [au tout]” but
“in Totality [au Tout].”1

[from wikipedia]

In the 1970s he was named corresponding member of the Institut de
France. He was also offered a position at the Sorbonne which he
declined, preferring to continue working in Nancy, where he was
friends with many other scientists.

Being opposed to the existentialism and the leftist trends of the
French post-war intelligentsia, Ruyer's work was better accepted in
scientific circles abroad than in France. Publicist Raymond Aron
advised him to try his luck at writing more popular works. His first
such attempts did not raise public interest. Therefore, based on the
assumption that the French public was more fascinated by scientific
developments in America, Ruyer published the book The Gnosis of
Princeton. He claimed to be in contact with a group of unidentified
American gnostic philosophers who were trying to create a new religion
identified as the Gnosis of Princeton, where most of these imaginary
scientists were active. Thereafter Raymond Ruyer presented his own
gnostic ideas. The book was a success as many of its readers were not
aware of the hoax for a long time. However, his next publications did
not raise interest in France, and were better known in Canada and the
United States.

Raymond Ruyer died in 1987 in Nancy. His last work, "Embryogenesis of
the World and the Silent God", was never published and is deposited as
a manuscript at the University of Nancy.

by Graham Harman.


Latour calls this complete constitution the 'Constitution' with a
capital C, to distinguish it from the political one. It defines
'humans and nonhumans, their properties and their relations, their
abilities and their groupings'.

Bruno Latour's theory of the modern constitution is based on four guarantees:

Nature is transcendent

Nature, or things and objects, are universal in time and space, and are there to be discovered.

Society is immanent

Society, or the state and subject, is continually constructed by citizens or subjects.

Translation networks are banned

The separation of powers between nature and society is assured, and translation networks between the two realms are banned.

A crossed out God acts as arbitrator

A crossed out God acts as the arbitrator of this dualism. 

Latour's theory also includes a broader definition of democracy, which focuses on regulating and moderating the production of hybrids. This final political task is considered to be the most potentially consequential part of Latour's theory, but also the most difficult to realize. 



`,

"descola-new-constitution":
`

We are then left to wonder whether a new constitution can really
appear and stabilize around a mode of identification whose development
is necessarily slower and more uncertain. I believe that this is not
impossible and may take the form of a shift toward the extreme
possibilities of naturalism.

We can thus imagine a system in which interiority is no longer
conceived of as one single block, as the distinctive property of a
being that is radically different from others. On the contrary, an
evanescent and pluralized interiority would be distributed across all
things, while physicality would remain universal, in a way that is
reminiscent of what can be observed in analogism.

That new analogism would thus be characterized by the diffraction of
the value that used to be placed on human interiority and its
dispersal over a broader and more open range of beings, one that
includes nonhumans but where the scientific method based on universal
laws of matter remains valid.

Such a transformation opens up a horizon of hope, as it allows us not
to feel locked into a self-enclosed naturalism, limited to
possibilities that have already been realized in history. And, since
it seems highly improbable that we return to animism or totemism,
which are now profoundly incompatible with irreversible elements in
our society (if only at a material level), the development of a new
analogism looks to me both more probable and more desirable: it is the
most capable mode of including nonhumans into our sociopolitical
constitution.

It will probably be necessary to invent novel forms of coupling
between beings, since the most common and effective form found in
large analogist collectives—be it the Indian caste system or the
system of orders of the ancien régime—is hierarchy, which is no longer
tolerable in a world that has known the emancipation of the
Enlightenment

**Walt Whitman: The Song of Myself, Jerome Loving, 1999**

  - 1848, Whitman and his brother Jeff traveled the Mississippi to
    New Orleans by steamboat, to take a newspaper job in the
    slave-holding south.  Slavery and slave auctions were
    everywhere to be seen.  Jeff wrote home, after visiting
    the cathedral: "everyone would go and dip their fingers in
    holy water and then go home and whip their slaves".
    Just around the corner from their first residence were the
    offices of Pierson & Bonneval, Auctioneers.  Their sales
    of flesh took place nearby, likely seen by the brothers:
    an "acre-large barroom", depicted in the poem. p 119.

  - Ralph Waldo Emerson, an early supporter of Whitman, had
    expressed his "respect for the body and his desire to arrive at an
    assessment of each person's value".  This may have helped lay the
    foundation for Whitman's similar thoughts in the poem. p 159

  - The poem is the fifth in the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass.
    It attained and held onto a prominent place in the Whitman canon, and
    for good reason.  In 1855, of course, it had no title and the
    ultimate title line was not even part of the poem until1867.  Nor
    were "electric" and "electricity" household words at the time.
    This was his first attempt (he told Emerson a year later) to
    express "the body of a man or woman" in poetry.  Leaves of Grass,
    it is seldom noted, was hardly ever, if at all, assailed in the
    19th C for its suggestions of homosexuality; the exception is
    Griswold's Latin adage which anticipated the phrase in the 1890s,
    "the love which dare not speak its name".  [note: congruent with
    Foucault's claim that homosexuality was invented in
    <a href="http://timothyquigley.net/vcs/foucault-homosexual.pdf"
    target="_blank">1870</a>?]  The
    problem with Leaves of Grass always and simply sexuality (of any
    sort?).  p 202

  - The poem came right out of the poet's Brooklyn and Long Island
    experience: the clue for which is that the poem contains a portrait
    drawn from the poet's lower-middle-class, working man's background.
    We have the octogenearian farmer, whom Whitman doubltless knew while
    growing up or teaching in the country - possibly his maternal
    grandfather, Cornelius Van Velso whom the poet adored. p203

  - The poem's electricity of the body is more than skin deep.
    Whitman is describing the "body" of his experience, and this body -
    like the one thr phrenologists, the century's health-fitness
    experts, knew - is ideal in its warmth, look and general appeal.
    The venerable farmer was virile enough to have sired five sones
    and probably as many daughters  He was a man who liked to
    sail his boar, go hungint, and generally be in the company of men.
    This is a man "you would wish long and long to be with" - describing
    how he pondered the contentment of lower nature - like sex, part
    of the Emersonian emblem left unmentioned in _Nature_.
    W was spearated from the object of his desire by "cold types
    and cylinders and wet paper" as well as society's implicit
    condemnation of the body and thus its spiritual essence. p204

  - Whitman did not abandon politics to write _Leaves of Grass_.
    In the surviving proofs he talks of "dough-faces"; the
    attempted renewal of slave trade, or the importation of
    slaves from other countries, particularly Cuba; and the fact
    that the founding fathers were (sic) "declared abolitionists".
    W announces that his call for freedom would be heard as far
    away as "the archipelagoes, Australia".  And the original
    title of the poem was "Slaves". p 212.

  - With the third edition of Leaves of Grass (1860?) three poems
    helped to develop the idea of Adamic man waking up to his
    sexuality and using it.  "Once I Pass'd Through a Populous City",
    harking back to his time in New Orleans, celebrates the joys of
    heterosexual love - though evidence suggests that the lover was
    once designated as male. p 249

  - In 1882 the Boston district attorney force changes to a new
    edition of Leaves of Grass, claiming that some parts of
    three poems, including "I Sing the Body Electric", violated
    the statutes of "obscene literature".  Some text from Sections
    5 and 9 describing a close-up tour of the body. p 414-15

  - _Leaves of Grass.  The Poems of Walt Whitman [Selected]_
    was published in 1886 omitting many poems including "I
    Sing the Body Electric".

**Amerindian Myth and Axiomatic Time**

[composition of worlds: 42%]

What is an Amerindian myth? It is a narrative, often somewhat quirky,
of how an animal or a plant species has acquired the appearance it
currently has. In the time of the myth (and this is actually an
inappropriate turn of phrase, which I am using here for the sake of
convenience), all living beings had the same body and culture, such
that the differences between them could be perceived only in their
names—Achuar, Toucan, Grasshopper, Cassava—and in their particular
habits and inclinations: in their house, the vulture-people ate
carcass ceremoniously, as if it were boiled meat, and the
jaguar-people lapped up blood as if it were manioc beer in
calabashes.

The myths recount the events that prompted each of these
forms of life, that of humans included, to acquire bodies that fitted
the uses to which they were put without actually losing their
subjective capabilities. These are stories of speciation, stories that
set out the accidental conditions for sudden changes of state.

At first glance, these myths are thus rather close to historical
narratives, minus the factual truth of the event. In reality they are
thought experiments through which a given fact of the world—that
nonhumans have an interiority like ours and bodies all different from
ours—can be conceptualized. The solution arrived at is that of a
metamorphosis, a switch of perspective that suddenly makes visible in
a body a set of dispositions that preexisted—in short, the
actualization of a potentiality.

It is a very abstract operation, reminiscent of the social contract in
European political philosophy—the contract that put an end to the
state of nature and legitimized political sovereignty. To paraphrase
Rousseau himself, just as the state of nature is a theoretical fiction
that does not exist, has never existed, and will never exist, the time
of myth is a necessary fiction for an ontological condition to receive
the illustrated expression of its actualization. To say, as is always
done at the beginning of a myth, that the events about to be described
took place a long time ago is not really to assign to these events a
place in time; it is more like assigning a time to an axiomatic
system. True, there is a time for an axiomatic system and a time for
demonstration, but that does not make the axiomatic system a period
sui generis.

And yet—and this is where the beauty and the subtlety of
this conception of time lies—axiomatic time is still very near, it is
two or three generations ago, perhaps; for the memory of recent time
does not exist. Many Achuar have forgotten the names of their
grandparents, the place where they lived, their achievements; and
there is little attempt to retain events beyond individuals’ living
memory and what they have themselves seen. In short, time is flattened
out, because with each generation it is brought back to the still very
recent past, when it was the condition of possibility of the immutable
present.

Mark the contrast between such a regime of time and that of a
world like ours, where the weight of filiation and of what we owe
previous generations and past centuries constantly looms over us and
where the past is supposed to determine what we are and to herald the
shape the future will take. A society in which none of this makes
sense, however much it might be governed by custom, gives an
impression of unlimited individual freedom: one is free of these
multiple legacies, of the weight of ancestral forces and history.

**Animism and Naturalism**

- animism: the enthnographic anchor, extneds the human form of
  interiority to nonhumans, paired with an awareness of
  physical discontinuities between the various classes of
  living beings in the worlds.  [composition of worlds, 48%]

- naturalism: no longer defined simply by a belief in the exitence of
  an external and objective nature, but through the systematic
  inversion of animism: different (or absent) interiority, bodies
  all fundamentally the same.

- each species has its own bodily dispositions [47%]
  ruyer's embryological, neo-finalist view: almost all entities

**What induces animsism?**

At first supposed that vast number of species, each in small numbers, led
to seeing ecological relations as interpersonal.   But the circumpolar north
disproves that.

There is another characteristic of both Amazonia and the great North
that is perhaps even more relevant to accounting for this conception of
nonhumans:  human inhabitants are few and far between, whereas nonhumans
are abundant.  human contact takes place only in the domestic sphere, or on occasional
visits to other houses.  Amerindians are de facto immersed in an ocean of
disparate beings, whose behavior they watch closely and whose habits they
know well, both for practical reasons and scientific curiosity

 - a taste of which is offered at spəqʷabs?

source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achuar" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>


The Achuar are an Indigenous people of the Americas belonging to the
Jivaroan family, alongside the Shuar, Shiwiar, Awajun, and Wampis
(Perú). They are settled along the banks of the Pastaza River, Huasaga
River, and on the borders between Ecuador and Perú. The word "Achuar"
originates from the name of the large palm trees called "Achu"
(Mauritia flexuosa) that are abundant in the swamps within their
territory.

In the past, the Achuar were traditionally feared warriors by the
Shuar, known for their relentless pursuit of enemies. During the
Cenepa War, the Achuar from Ecuador and Peru formed an alliance and
maintained a neutral stance.

**Descola on warrior culture"

[from composition of worlds, 29%]

During the few months we spent in that first village, the Achuar
seemed, on the contrary, to be peaceful, a far cry from the usual
clichés of deceitful and bloodthirsty Jivaros. To be sure, the men
always carried their rifles with them, especially for visits, and this
was a habit I myself eventually adopted.

I quickly realized that the
man who was now my ritual friend had abducted his first wife a few
years earlier, in the course of a raid against the southern Achuar
during which the woman’s first husband was killed, yet none of it
seemed to show in the evident affection the two had for each other. It
was also clear that the men were prone to flying off the handle and
that the slightest hint of a conflict between distant relatives in the
Achuar country could cause bellicose bluster; but it was difficult to
tell whether it would lead to actual warfare.

On the whole, however,
daily life in that first village was peaceful and it was only later
and in more remote areas that I was confronted to situations of armed
conflict. It was also only later, after careful cross-checking, that I
realized that most of these good-humored Achuar, who had welcomed us
with such generosity when we arrived in the upper Kapawi, had killed a
man on at least one occasion.

Upon my return from fieldwork, I
developed the notion of predation when trying to understand this
warring ethos, which even the women shared, since they were the first
to encourage men to take revenge for an assassination, a death
attributed to witchcraft, or even an affront. Against the prevalent
interpretation at the time—which treated war in Amazonia as an
exchange of dead persons comparable to an exchange of goods, and thus
posited a symbolic continuity between commerce and vendetta—I operated
on the premise that the Achuar’s attitude to enemies and to hunting
game was based on the same rejection of reciprocity.

This rejection
was not intended to annihilate the other, be it human or animal, or to
express supremacy or contempt. Quite the opposite: the hunts,
abductions, and murders, as well as the rituals that accompanied them,
expressed a conception of predation that took the other, which is
materially or symbolically consumed, to be indispensable to the
perpetuation of one’s own existence. The other that is absorbed in war
or hunting is thus not an object, as in the mass slaughter of the
twentieth century, but indeed a person like me and, as such, a
condition of my own life—which corresponds to the biological
definition of predation. But I realized this only much later.

"creator-vs-creature":
`
**From Descola, Beyond Nature and Culture, Heroic Producion**

In the famous pages of his "General Introduction" to A Contribution to
a Critique of Political Economy, Marx stresses that "the act of
production is, therefore, in all its aspects an act of consumption as
well."20 This is because, in the first place, the individual who
develops his faculties by producing something expends energy in this
operation and consumes raw materials, which are the means of
production; this is "productive consumption." But consumption is also,
in an immediate fashion, a production, in the sense that all
consumption, whether of food or other things, contributes toward
creating the body and the conditions of subsistence of the subject who
produces it; this is "produc-tion geared to consumption." "In the
first [productive consumption], the producer transforms himself into
things; in the second [consumptive pro-duction], things are
transformed into human beings."21 Although an identity is established
between production and consumption, this is only possible thanks to a
mediating movement between the two terms: "Production furthers
consumption by creating material for the latter, which otherwise would
lack its object. But consumption, in its turn, furthers production, by
providing for the products the individual for whom they are the
prod-ucts."22 However, this extremely original dialectical parity
between object-ivizing production and subjectivizing consumption fades
away a few lines further on, when Marx forthrightly reaffirms the
primacy of production over consumption. In effect, consumption is
simply a particular moment in production since, once the individual
who has produced an object returns it to himself by consuming it, he
is acting as a productive individual who is thereby reproducing
himself; in consequence, "production forms the actual starting point
and is, therefore, the predominating factor."23

Marx's position is indicative of the more general tendency of modern
thought to regard production as the element that determines the
material conditions of social life and as the principal way for humans
to transform nature and, by doing so, transform themselves. Whether or
not one is a Marxist, it is now commonly thought that the history of
humanity is primarily founded on the dynamism introduced by a
succession of ways of producing use value and exchange value of the
materials that the environment provides. But it is fair to question
whether this preeminence ascribed to the process of productive
objectivization applies generally to all societies.24 To be sure,
humans have always and everywhere been productive; everywhere they
have modified or fashioned substances intentionally in order to
procure themselves the means of existence, thereby exercising their
capacity to behave as agents who impose specific forms and purposes
upon matter that is independent of themselves. But does this mean that
this kind of action is everywhere apprehended in accordance with the
model of a relation to the world known as “production,” a model so
paradigmatic and familiar to us that we have become accustomed to use
it to describe extremely heterogeneous operations carried out in very
diverse contexts? It seems hardly necessary to recall first that the
idea of production by no means suffices to define the general manner
in which many hunter-gatherers conceive of their subsistence
techniques. That is why some specialists of those societies now prefer
to use the term “procurement” rather than “production,” the better to
underline that what we call hunting and gathering are primarily
specialized forms of interaction that develop in an environment
peopled with intentional entities that are comparable to humans.25 But
the inadequacy of the notion of production is also obvious when it
comes to accounting for the way in which great non-Western
civilizations conceptualize the process by which things are
engendered. François Jullien shows this clearly, in the case of China,
in his commentary on the oeuvre of Wang Fuzhi.26 For this
seventeenth-century neo-Confucian scholar, who systematizes a
fundamental intuition of Chinese thought, the whole of reality can be
conceived as a continuous process resulting from the interaction of
two principles, neither of which is more fundamental or more original
than the other: for example, yin and yang, or Heaven and Earth. From
this stems a logic of a mutual relationship with no beginning and no
end that excludes any external founding agent, any need for a
creator-agent as an initial cause or prime mover and any reference to
some transcendent “otherness.” The process of rest alternating with
movement that is given dynamism by the primacy of movement acts in a
totally impersonal and unintentional manner. “So order cannot be
imposed from outside by a deliberate act of some subject or other
implementing a certain plan …; it is inherent in the nature of things
and stems totally from their continuous development.”27 In short, the
world is not produced by the intervention of an actor with a plan and
a will. It results solely from its own internal propensities (lishi),
which manifest themselves spontaneously in a permanent flux of
transformations. This self-regulated process is a far cry indeed from
the heroic model of creation as developed in the West and proclaimed
as an unquestioned fact on the twofold authority of the biblical
tradition and Greek thought. The idea of production as the imposition
of form upon inert matter is simply an attenuated expression of the
schema of action that rests upon two interdependent premises: the
preponderance of an individualized intentional agent as the cause of
the coming-to-be of beings and things, and the radical difference
between the ontological status of the creator and that of whatever he
produces. According to the paradigm of creation-production, the
subject is autonomous and his intervention in the world reflects his
personal characteristics: whether he is a god, a demiurge, or a simple
mortal, he produces his oeuvre according to a preestablished plan and
with a definite purpose—hence the abundance of craftsmanship metaphors
that are used to express the origin of this type of relationship. In
the Psalms, the Creator is compared to a well-sinker, a gardener, a
potter, and an architect. In the Timaeus, the demiurge creates the
world, fashioning it as a potter would. He carefully composes the
mixture that he is about to work on; he turns it on his wheel to form
a sphere, then he rounds it off and polishes the surface.

surface.28 Here, the image of fabrication, poiesis, is central; and so
it remains in the modern conception of the relationship of a producer
and that which he produces. What also remains is the idea of the
absolute heterogeneity between them: the creator, craftsman, or
producer possesses his own plan of the thing that he will bring into
existence and gives himself the technical means to realize his
intended purpose by projecting his will upon the matter that he
manipulates. In the same way, just as the Creator and his creation are
incommensurable in Christian dogma, in the Western tradition there is
no ontological equivalence between the producer and whatever he brings
into being. Nothing could be more alien to the manner in which the
Indians of Amazonia construe their relations with the entities upon
which they feed. For the Achuar, for example, it would be meaningless
to speak of “agricultural production” or “hunting production,” as
though the aim of those activities were to bring into being a
consumable product that would be ontologically dissociated from the
material from which it came—even if such operations may come to be
quantified and assessed vis-à-vis the potential productivity of
resources, as by myself in the past.29 Achuar women do not “produce”
the plants that they cultivate: they have a personal relationship with
them, speaking to each one so as to touch its soul and thereby to win
it over, and they nurture its growth and help it to survive the perils
of life, just as a mother helps her children. Achuar men do not
“produce” the animals that they hunt. They negotiate with them
personally, in a circumspect relationship made up, in equal parts, of
cunning and seduction, trying to beguile them with misleading words
and false promises. In other words, here it is the relations between
subjects (humans and nonhumans) that condition the “production” of the
means of existence, not the production of objects that conditions
(human) relationships. In Amazonia, even the production of artifacts
seems not to fit into the classic model of the
demiurge-craftsman. This is what is suggested by Lúcia van Velthem’s
studies of the wickerwork of the Wayana of the northern Pará, who,
like some of their Carib and Arawak neighbors, are noted for the
diversity and refinement, both technical and aesthetic, of the objects
that they plait.30 Wickerwork is a masculine activity that is both
valued and prestigious, complete mastery of which is acquired only
quite late in life, at least in the creation of the most difficult
pieces such as the great katari anon, the carrying basket that is
entirely decorated by plaited motifs that differ on each of the
external and internal sides. However, the Wayana regard the
fabrication of baskets, not as a virtuoso fashioning of a raw
material, but rather as an incomplete actualization, in slightly
different forms, of the bodies of animal spirits that they
reconstitute using plant fibers that are assimilated to human
skin. Their baskets, receptacles, trays, mats, and plaited containers
in which they press manioc are thus, as van Velthem puts it,
“transformed bodies.”31 Each has an anatomy—a head, limbs, breasts, a
trunk, ribs, buttocks, and genitals—and the motifs that adorn them are
stylized representations of the being of which they constitute a
transmutation. The designs on the inner sides of baskets even
represent that being’s internal organs: the point is to evoke in this
way the predatory capacity of assimilation of an animal’s spirit,
which, however, is rendered inoffensive in the artifact by virtue of
its incompleteness. Since the fiber body differs from the threatening

body of the prototype of which it is an actualization, given that it
is not recomposed altogether identically, it lacks the intentionality
of the original. However, that is only so in the case of domestic
basketry, the daily use of which makes it necessary somehow to
“devitalize” it. Objects woven for ceremonial use are said, on the
contrary, to be complete materializations of the bodies of animal
spirits. The most expert of the basket makers are even credited with
the ability to recompose in their handiwork the nonvisual
characteristics of the prototype, such as its movements, sounds, and
smells. This ontological mimetism allows these objects to function, in
their turn, as agents of transformation. They are used extensively in
healing rites, since they possess properties identical to those of the
entities of which they are reincarnations. Far from being apprehended
as the production-creation, out of inanimate material, of a new thing
informed by the art and purpose of an autonomous agent, the work of a
Wayana basket weaver is regarded as something that can make a
veritable metamorphosis possible; that is to say, it can produce a
change in the state of an entity that already exists as a subject and
that preserves all or part of its attributes throughout this
operation. As a way of conceiving action on the world and a specific
relationship in which a subject generates an object, production thus
does not have a universal applicability. It presupposes the existence
of a clearly individualized agent who projects his interiority on to
indeterminate matter in order to give form to it and thus bring into
existence an entity for which he alone is responsible and that he can
then appropriate for his own use or exchange for other realities of
the same type. Now, to return to our two examples: the production
model does not correspond either to the concept of a continuous
autopoietic process as expressed in Chinese thought or to the priority
that, in Amazonia, is granted to reciprocal transformation over
fabrication ex nihilo. For this reason, anthropologists are perhaps
unwise when they succumb to the convenient temptation to use the
familiar language of production to interpret the very diverse
phenomena by means of which a reality, whether or not of a material
nature, comes to be instituted. To speak of the “production” of a
person, of social links, of a subject, or of the difference between
the sexes outside the Western context, in which, for several
millennia, this notion has encompassed an altogether singular
relationship, is at best, in most cases, an abuse of language that
leads to false parallels.

<a href="https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/214/bachianas-brasileiras-no-1"
   target="_blank">from LA Phil</a>

The nine pieces to which Villa-Lobos gave the title Bachianas
Brasileiras all date from between 1930 and 1945. In them he sought to
explore what he felt to be the links between the music of Bach and
that of his native Brazil – an oblique connection if ever there was
one. Villa-Lobos saw in Bach’s instrumental writing, in the way that
so much emphasis is placed on the interweaving of equally important
contrapuntal strands, an echo of the freedom of part writing which he
found in the folk music of his own country. Many of the movements in
the series have dual titles, one relating to Baroque forms, the other
to indigenously Brazilian ones.

The pieces vary in their scoring. The first, like the fifth, calls for
eight cellos, but lacks the solo soprano of the later work. It was
completed in 1930. The most obvious Bachian reference here is in the
final fugue, albeit on a theme which is closer to Rio than to
Leipzig. The theme itself emerges in the opening Embolada, a form of
folksong characterized by a refrain and response structure. The
central Modinha alludes to a generic term for a type of Portuguese
popular song, usually of a sentimental character.

**Epigraph to Viveiros de Castro's essay "Metaphysics as Mythophysics"
in "comparative metaphysics" by Peter Skafish**

Now that capitalism, political liberalism, and technoscience have
become the chief modes of thought of much of the planet, it should be
apparent that an approach to thinking capable of engaging anything
outside them will have not only to critique their basic categories
... but to operate both at and beyond the limits of the metaphysics on
which they are based.

"Subjects," "histories," and "truths" not
belonging to the West can be listened to and understood only if the
concepts (of the subject, of history, and of truth) used to interpret
them are enough at the borders of metaphysics to cross them and
thereby become estranged by the other.

The general tendency in the
humanities, however, is to assume that such basic terms of analysis
can be employed (even simply "applied") without being revised. The
disturbing result is the silent and thus all the more insidious
reinstatement of metaphysics, a situation that ideologically reflects
the basic condition of the "new world order — "the impossibility," as
Malabou characterizes it, of any exotic, isolated, or geopolitically
marginal event," and the neutralization and "exhaustion of the
outside." A "terrible" time in which it seems that "everything has
already happened" that could, and when, one can add, intellectual
thought seems destined to remain forever European.

<ul>

   <li> Ontology refers to things that actually exist, while metaphysics is
     concerned with both possible and actual existence.

   <li> Different schools and philosophers have radically different
     understandings of the distinction [between metaphysics and ontology].
</ul>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics"

<ul>

   <li> Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the basic
     structure of reality. It is often characterized as first
     philosophy, implying that it is more fundamental than other forms
     of philosophical inquiry.

   <li> Metaphysics is traditionally seen as
     the study of mind-independent features of the world, but some
     modern theorists understand it as an inquiry into the conceptual
     schemes that underlie human thought and experience - a worldview?

   <li> A worldview or Weltanschauung is the fundamental cognitive
     orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of
     the individual's or society's knowledge, culture, and point of
     view. A worldview can include natural philosophy; fundamental,
     existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values,
     emotions, and ethics.

</ul>

**Dilthey on Veltanschauung**
<ul>
   <li> In 1911, the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey published an
     essay entitled "The Types of Weltanschauung and their Development
     in Metaphysics" that became quite influential. Dilthey
     characterized worldviews as providing a perspective on life that
     encompasses the cognitive, evaluative, and volitional aspects of
     human experience.

        <li> Dilthey continued: Although worldviews have always been expressed
          in literature and religion, philosophers have attempted to give
          them conceptual definition in their metaphysical systems. On that
          basis, Dilthey found it possible to distinguish three general
          recurring types of worldview.

        <li> The first of these he called naturalism because it gives
          priority to the perceptual and experimental determination of
          what is and allows contingency to influence how we evaluate
          and respond to reality. Naturalism can be found in
          Democritus, Hobbes, Hume and many other modern philosophers.

        <li> The second type of worldview is called the idealism of
          freedom and is represented by Plato, Descartes, Kant, and
          Bergson among others. It is dualistic and gives primacy to
          the freedom of the will. The organizational order of our
          world is structured by our mind and the will to know.

        <li> The third type is called objective idealism and Dilthey sees
          it in Heraclitus, Parmenides, Spinoza, Leibniz and Hegel. In
          objective idealism the ideal does not hover above what is
          actual but inheres in it. This third type of worldview is
          ultimately monistic and seeks to discern the inner coherence
          and harmony among all things. Dilthey thought it impossible
          to come up with a universally valid metaphysical or
          systematic formulation of any of these worldviews, but
          regarded them as useful schema for his own more reflective
          kind of life philosophy.

**An extract**

Western European man characteristically regards himself not only as an
independent entity in a fundamentally hostile environment but as the
relatively permanent factor in a perishing world and the sole source in it of
value. Most Western European poetry is, even in its erotic lyric "Gather ye
rosebuds while ye may" concerned with the tragedy of the waste of value in a
world of fact.

<p>
There is nothing of this in American Indian poetry. The intense
aesthetic realization which precedes the poem is a realization of identity
with a beneficent environment. Often this is focused in a dream or vision,
waking or sleeping, after long lonely fast and vigil in the forest or
desert. An aspect of the environment, an animal or a natural object or force,
appears to the Indian, waiting in a trance state, and gives him the song,
which remains his most precious possession and the pivot of his life forever
after.

<p>
As such, however simple, these songs always express mutual acceptance
and approval of the self and the other, focused but also generalized,
amounting to identification.

<p>In other words, the holy is not the
Judeo-Protestant "utterly other" a term of Otto's but the utterly same. They
also express the accompanying emotional state - a feeling of extraordinarily
intense hyperesthesia, concentration of all faculties in one realization, and
the emotional tone of the realization itself - what we call transfiguration
and transcendence - the kind of general sacramentalism we identify with

Read by Alan Davis Drake</a>


Whitman celebrates human bodies in his poem from 1855:  specific flesh, and
body parts, male and female.  We find some sexism and, at what at the time was
surely scandalous homoerotic sexuality.

<p>Whitman starts safely, extolling manly upright
farmers, laborers, and young men wrestling.  He moves to women - all, as with the
males, implicitly white.  He then turns, in sections 7 and 8 of this 9
stanza poem, to

<blockquote>
   A man's body at auction...
   A woman's body at auction...
</blockquote>

and his purpose becomes clear.  Humans all, intricate and beautiful, strong and worthy:
this is an anti-slavery poem, arguing for the equal beauty and worth of all human bodies.

<blockquote>
Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve...
</blockquote>

Whitman's vision is uncommon today.  Novel machines and the artificial
excite more admiration than the mundane, the organic.  Whitman saw
and proclaimed wonder and beauty in the world, with an enthusiasm
which though, today, sometimes seems over-ripe, might - if refracted through new
understandings of the world - serve me well.

I follow Whitman but I wish to go further.  We have learned much about
the elegance and interconnectedness of life in the last century.  The
dividing line between human and other has dissolved.  We have huge
brains which make complex grammars possible, and metaphor and music.
Other species have their own capabilities just as worthy of
admiration.

But rather than compare and rank (or compare and <b>not</b> rank), my focus, building on
Whitman, is on seeing the interwoven elegant processes shared by all of us, indeed
coursing through all of us, energy captured non-destructively from the sun, exciting
electrons which flow in all life forms, from sunlit leaf to scampering squirrel, deep diving
whales, laughing children, symbiotic relations, even also contagious disease.

The body electric: now to see it as the entire evolving interconnected communities of the planet.

When first published, the poem had no title.  When republished in 1867 with some revisions,
the first line was added, and became the title.   Jerome Loving's 1999
<a href="" target="_blank">biography</a> (need more detail here)
explains that the term "electric" was not then in common use.

From Carol Rumen's "Poem of the Week" in the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/27/poem-of-the-week-from-i-sing-the-body-electric-by-walt-whitman" target="_blank">Guardian</a>:

<blockquote>

It was one of 12 poems Whitman printed and published himself as Leaves of Grass (1855), the first collection of a writer who, in his mid-30s, had suddenly found his unique form and themes.
<p>
The poem was untitled, and began somewhat less ringingly, with a version of what was subsequently to become the second line. Revised, and with the addition of Part 9, the section that forms this week’s poem, it appeared as Poem of the Body in the 1856 edition of Leaves of Grass, and was ultimately incorporated into the sequence Children of Adam (1867).
<p>
The length and bagginess of Whitman’s inventory have provoked some criticisms. It doesn’t strictly follow the organisational principles that first seem to operate – head to toes, exterior to interior. There’s some mixing of categories as the poem gathers speed near the end. But the rollercoaster is still an exciting, if a bumpy, ride. The specificity of the diction is a clear virtue: where it’s less than specific, the euphemism or obscure coinage (man-root, neck-slue) forms a collectible linguistic curio. The way in which medically untrained people talk about their bodies is always fascinating. For most of us, the vocabulary is an odd, rather embarrassed assortment of the informal and the official, and so it is with Whitman. His vocabulary includes the plainest, everyday denotations – head, eyes, mouth and nose – with a few Latinate sprinklings: tympan and scapula. Some compound words are invented but vividly understandable: eye-fringes, hind-shoulders and lung-sponges. Sometimes, there’s an added descriptive detail, like “The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame”, that he seems to write from the experience of viewing preserved human remains.
<p>
As the list accumulates, abstract nouns appear – sympathies, sexuality, maternity. Whitman deliberately makes his case for the inclusion of women in the democratic body, and emotions enter the mix of feminine attributes (“tears, laughter, weeping, love-look …”). The figure is not always gendered: sometimes it could be either male or female, and, perhaps, either black or white: “The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair.” A particular relationship just might be evoked in “The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body”. There are a few other moments when a detail will suggest that the universal love-poem embraces a personal love-affair, but there are no details that can’t be read as modes of the universal.
<p>
As the section unfolds, the body seems increasingly active, whether “reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening” or displaying in close-up “The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes.” It’s plain that the speaker has closely observed actual bodies in motion. For all the excited, headlong oratory, Whitman is at least as much a scientist as a romantic poet. The very phrase “body electric” includes both dimensions.
<p>
The body he animates is electrified above all by the way in which the parts interact, whether the interaction is explicit or implied, and by the way in which bodies interact, in mutual respect or its opposite, exploitation. As he tells us, bodies (“the likes of you and me”) are poems. This particular praise-song is to the young, healthy body, idealised, perhaps, but not in any sense deified. How astonishing it seems now that lines so frank in vocabulary (and metrically so free) could have been written in 1855. But then, this was the New World, and Whitman’s first symphony.

Some etymological background:

   - electric eels were known in pharaonic egypt

   - Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius
     Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks
     delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that
     such shocks could travel along conducting objects.  Patients with
     ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric
     fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.[4]

   - Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual
     curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist
     William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful
     study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone
     effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He
     coined the Neo-Latin word electricus ("of amber" or "like amber",
     from ἤλεκτρον, elektron, the Greek word for "amber") to refer to
     the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This
     association gave rise to the English words "electric" and
     "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in
     Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.

   - Michael Faraday inventied the electric motor in 1821.

   - Thomas Edison's patent for the electric light bulb was issued in 1880.

`
**Reflective Equilibrium**

From <u>Considered Judgement</u> by Catherine Elgin, 1995, Preface,
page ix.

Philosophy long sought to set knowledge on a firm foundation, through
derivation of indubitable truths by infallible rules.  For want of
such truths and rules, the enterprise foundered.  Certainty is not to
be had.

Nevertheless, foundationalism's heirs continue thier forebears' quest,
seeking security against epistemic misfortune.  Their detractors
typically espouse unbridled coherentism or a facile cultural relativism.

Neither stance is tenable.  To devise a via media between the absolute
and the arbitrary requires reconceiving the nature, goals, and methods
of epistemology.

[This book] develops and argues for a reconception that takes
reflective equilibrium as the standard of rational acceptability.
A system of thought is in reflective equilibrium when its components
are reasonable in light of one another, and the account they comprise is
reasonable in light of our antecedent convictions about the
subject at hand.  Such a system affords no guarantees.  It is rationally
acceptable, I contend, not because it is certainly true but because
it is reasonable in the epistemic circumstances.

Since such a position forsakes the goals of certainty and permanent
credibility, I begin by arguing that those goals cannot, in any
case, be met. I then develop the positive account, showing that it has
valuable resources that more familiar approaches lack.

Many epistemologists now concede that certainty is a chimerical goal.
But they continue to accept the traditional conception of
epistemology's problematic.  For them, the quest remains how to
justify literal, factual beliefs.

I suggest that in abandoning the quest for certainty we gain
opportunities for a broader epistemological purview -- one that
comprehends the arts and does justice to the sciences.

The position I advocate thus recognizes that metaphor, fiction,
emotion and exemplification often advance understanding in
science as well as in art.

The range of epistemology turns out to be broader and
more variegated than is usually recognized.  Tenable systems of
thought are neither absolute nor arbitrary.  But even though
they are subject to revision, they are good in ways of belief.

"simondonOverview":
`
**Gilbert Simondon (1924-1989)**

From <u>The Incorporeal: Ontology, Ethics and the Limits of Materialism</u>,
Elizabeth Grosz, 2017, Chapter 5, Simondon and the Preindividual.

Simondon aims to replace the study of ontology, of what is, with the
study of ontogenesis, the various processes of self-formation that create
what is. Simondon devoted his earliest writings to the pre-Socratics, for
whom nature was the unquestioned source of existence and creativity.3
He was thoroughly steeped in ancient philosophy, from the writings of
Plato, Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics, in many cases returning to pre-Platonic conceptions of the coexistence of life and nature, to
the kind of philosophy that existed before science, poetry, the arts, and
philosophy became separated. The separation and privileging of form
over matter—hylomorphism—which began with Socrates and is accomplished by Aristotle, becomes a significant conceptual obstacle to a thoroughgoing understanding of the continuities and discontinuities, the
rising and falling of order and information, that connects the human,
and other forms of life, to the orders of the universe. p 170.

**The Preindividual**

Insofar as an individual exists, there must be a process, or many,
that produces it. This is Simondon’s most basic axiom—to seek out the
phases by which, from initial conditions, a being comes into
existence, not through an identity, a preformed path, or the
imposition of a preexisting form or plan on unformed matter. Such
conceptions are hylomorphic: they consider matter to be passive and
unformed—indeed, they are considered fundamentally feminine since at
least the time of Aristotle, if not before, and form to be a
masculine, active, imposing, ordering process. I have suggested
elsewhere that the dichotomization of thought through presence and
absence into dualistic and mutually exclusive terms—mind and body,
reason and passion, self and other—may have its origins in the
transformation of sexual difference into sexual opposition (the most
elementary gesture of patriarchy). [see Elizabeth Grosz, <i>The
Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution, and the Untimely</i> 2004.


It is the transformation of difference that Simondon addresses. Not
only is the hylomorphic schema unable to explain the coming into
existence of individuals, its terms, form and matter, require that
their own geneses as individuals be addressed. His challenge to
hylomorphism is an analysis of the coming into existence of
hylomorphism itself, the ontogenesis of philosophical models that,
because of their binarized structure, have lost direct contact with
the preindividual forces that are used to produce and sustain the
various orders of individuations.

source: Five Years Behind Hitler's Barbed Wire: A Diary of French Officers in a German Prison Camp, 1940-1945,
Henri Natter and Adam Refregier.

One of the more notable and searing events of World War II was the
unexpected and sudden fall of France in 1940, a major liberal
democracy with a glorious military past, the débâcle as it quickly
became known. Swiftly and efficiently overrun by the Wehrmacht in late
spring 1940 in only a matter of weeks, France suffered a crushing blow
to its morale and national pride that just several decades before had
been uplifted by difficult and costly victories at Verdun and the
first and second battles of the Marne.
<p>

This is the story of French officers, prisoners of war in an Oflag in
the Third Reich. Many books and stories have been written about the
numerous German prison camps during World War II, but very little has
been told about Oflags, camps specifically for Allied officers, who by
international convention were not required to work. Non-commissioned
officers and enlisted men were sent to stalags, from where they
generally went to work for the Germans.
<p>
Yet, when the
dust settled at the end of the battle for France in 1940, of the two
million men prisoners of war (mostly French: 1,800,000) 36,000 were
officers. The majority remained prisoners for as much as five years.

Five thousand French officers were sent to Oflag XVIIA, located in a
mountainous area northwest of Vienna, Austria. These men who had held
leading positions, either in the military or as civilians, were thrown
together at random in deplorable living conditions with nothing to do,
leaving them idle all day except for meals and roll calls. The curse
of idle time became an oppor-tunity. Setting up their own
administrative structure, and over the years utilizing their
wide-ranging knowledge and know-how, they created a small town with
its own university, library, newspaper, theater, and orchestra.

<p>

Ruyer spent almost the entire war in a pris-oner-of-war camp on the
grounds of former Wehrmacht training barracks in northeastern
Austria. The prisoners of Oflag XVIl-A, as it was called, enjoyed a
relatively high degree of freedom, and were encouraged to keep busy
during the long months of captivity.  Among the officers at the camp
were a good number of academics, and so these men organized lectures
on mathematics, philosophy, and biology, among other subjects. They
called themselves the Université en captivité.

Wolff, early in an eminent career as a teratologist (an embryologist
focused on abnormalities), held a private, high-level biology seminar
that Ruyer attended for more than a year.  In his memoirs, Wolff
recalled that Ruyer stood out in the group not only because, as a
professional philosopher, he was a relative outsider to biology, but
also because of his distinctive, at times "paradoxical" approach to
biological problems. As Wolff remem-bered, "[Ruyer] had a precise, if
a bit literary, knowledge of biological problems like any scholar
trained in the classics without himself having experimented on living
matter."

<p>

Ruyer's study of embryology at the Universit en captivité
fundamentally transformed his philosophical project. His pre-war
philosophy had articulated a universal, mechanist ontology of
structure. In the postwar period he moved toward a materialist
finalism. His study of embryology under the guidance of Wolff helped
him transform his mechanist ontology into the neo-finalist materialism
for which he is known. It also helped him resolve a specific problem,
that of temporality, which he had been unable to account for in his
earliest work.

**Felicitous Falsehoods**<br>

This is philosopher Catherine Elgin's felicitous phrase, introduced in her 2017
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Enough-Press-Catherine-Elgin/dp/0262036533/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GSR2ATI0U171&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aL_vZYUZWgm5mBgiqZ3ycmxP92FGZLHCV5rJkDoi5bJdZCnNAXJbd6muiMt3vT-9mecyYcnI09UkqT1bf-7pcpoeFTsxt8Ce5f9L8NsA57Tf8FOtg1PYP8VWt9oiFBFnaixb8n3iee13OeoKNXteFQ0L1C3HrO09UtvSn02aSoatnZbIN52x5zhGQar6j7ZLEABDbz5P3-qQJN6q5O64jsNIOm7hmDFRBulRJYQAWXQ.cUCW37_AwICiPyZxcInJ7nUmbw6lx50TqawSsjf9ozI&dib_tag=se&keywords=catherine+elgin&qid=1725045264&s=books&sprefix=catherine+elgin%2Cstripbooks%2C162&sr=1-1" target="_blank">True Enough</a>.   

She shows, as I will
selectively reproduce here, felicitous falsehoods - models, theories, thought experiments, metaphors -
are crucial to finding our way in the world.

<blockquote>

Philosophy valorizes truth. There may be practical or prudential or
political reasons to accept a known falsehood. But there can, it is
held, never be epistemically good reasons to do so. Nor can there be
good reasons to accept modes of justification that are known not to be
truth conducive. Such is the prevailing consensus.

<p> Although it seems
reasonable, this stance has a fatal flaw. It cannot account for the
epistemic standing of science: for science unabashedly relies on
models, idealizations, and thought experiments that are known not to
be true.

<p>Modern science is one of humanity's greatest cognitive
achievements. To think that this achievement is a fluke would be
mad. So epistemology has the task of accounting for science's
success. A truth-centered, or veritistic, epistemology must treat
models, idealizations, and thought experiments as mere heuristics, or
forecast their disappearance with the advancement of scientific
understanding. Neither approach is plausible.

<p>We should not cavalierly
assume that the inaccuracy of models and idealizations constitutes an
inadequacy; quite the opposite. I suggest that their divergence from
truth or representational accuracy fosters their epistemic
functioning. When effective, models and idealizations are, I contend,
felicitous falsehoods. They are more than heuristics. They are
ineliminable and epistemically valuable components of the
understanding science supplies.

**Backstories**<br>

Backstories abound.  We have Marx and Darwin, we have Christian,
Jewish and Islamic cosmic narratives from Genesis to the Battle of
Armageddon.  We have the American founding and exceptionalism, the
recent neoliberal prediction of "an end to history", the AI
Singularity and human/machine hybrids populating the galaxy.  Or
nuclear holocaust, the heat death of the universe, a looming sixth
great extinction.  These narratives are all part of the cultural mix
in which I live.

<p>Indigenous narratives
from across the globe are often of a different sort, strong on origin
stories, less obvioulsy focused on cosmic goals and endpoints to achieve.

<p> Not so clearly stated, but nearly universal in the west, interlaced
with western narratives, is what we might call the "Triumphant Human Career", our species
sui generis, risen from obscure origins to dominate the planet, eventually also the
solar system and the galaxy: <i>that</i> is the narrative, the story, the meaning of life.

<blockquote> todo: incorporate, but don't get overwhelmed by and stuck in,
Kermode's "The Sense of an Ending", Eliade's "The Myth of the Eternal Return"
Descola's four ontologies in Beyond Nature and Culture.
</blockquote>

<p> I will not - indeed, I am unable to - argue for or against the
truth of any of these.  Each tells a story.  Each has a
beginning. Many propose, a goal, a direction.

<p> I would rather ask the
anthropologist's question: not "which of these  is True?" but rather "what does
each imply, how did they arise, and what forms of life and further stories come from them?"

<p>
And I also ask:  what narratives shape my own view of the world?  Some of them explicit, known to me,
but some imperfectly, incompletely or entirely unknown as I go about my business.
And what freedom, and by what means achieved, may I reorder, rearrange, maybe replace some of them?

<p> Philosopher Catherine Elgin and anthropologist Clifford Geertz are among those who
guide me in my efforts to ask and answer these questions.

<p> I keep and tend this digital garden to explore these questions.

<p>

The approach I develop here focuses on a cognitive process called
conceptual metaphor, which is a common denominator of material culture
and language. Previous studies have shown that the conceptual
metaphors of ancestral speech communities are embedded in the
documented languages of their descendants.  Recent archaeological
research shows that these metaphors are also expressed in
archaeological material culture.

<p> Based on these findings I suggest it
is possible to relate archaeological complexes to protolanguages by
correlating conceptual systems as they are expressed in the
archaeological record and in potentially related languages.

<p> I will
first review current methods for relating archaeology and language and
discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then I will introduce
conceptual metaphor as an additional basis for linking archaeology and
language, show how one can reconstruct protometaphors from linguistic
and archaeological evidence, and apply these methods in a case study
that traces the migration of a specific speech community from its
homeland in the Mesa Verde region of the U.S. Southwest.

<blockquote>We are stardust. We are golden. We are billion year old carbon.</blockquote>

<p>This comes from the 1969 Joni Mitchell song, <i>Woodstock</i>. The
song may be a dated, hippie, period piece, but there is some good
science in the chorus. Stars shine because of the nuclear fusion of
hydrogen to form helium in the star's interior. After billions of
years, most of a star's hydrogen is used up so the star's core
collapses and gets even hotter.

<p>Depending on the star's mass, the collapsing core may cause
additional fusion reactions which produce heavier elements such as
iron. Some of these stars explode in a massive supernova which flings
all these elements into space, where they collide with interstellar
dust and gas. This is where chemical compounds like carbon and water,
the stuff that we are made of, are formed in the universe. We are, in
fact, stardust.

**WindsFromTheNorth: Tewa Origins and Historical Anthropology**<br>

Anthropologist Scott Ortman, combining cultural anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics
in his study of the Mesa Verde -> Tewa transition, argues in four parts for, not just correlation,
but some (reciprocal?) causation as well.
<ul>
   <li> Culture as shared mental models
   <li> How to read ancient minds
   <li> Metaphor and major transitions
   <li> An hypothesis on culture and complexity
</ul>

He hypothesizes correlations between metaphoric transformations and qualitative
changes in the scale, integration and differentiation, complexity of human society.
How might these metaphors actually encouraged those kinds of changes?
<p>
The migration from Mesa Verde (and Chaco Canyon?) to the upper Rio Grande Valley,
and the origin of the Teva culture, about 1250 BC, is accompanied, this
archaeolgist argues, in a shift from bowl metaphors, to upright corn/people/rain
rectilinear images.
<p>


Documents the shift, in language and material history, from a bowl
metaphor to rectilinear.   See minute 28 in the video below.  Bowl
images in historical linguistics, while upright corn/person images
are present in contempory Tewa songs.

<p>

The Tewa-speaking pueblos near Santa Fe have always claimed ancestry
from the ancient peoples the Apache called "Anasazi" - those ancient
ones who vanished rather abruptly from Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon
around 800 years ago. It's taken careful work by Dr. Scott Ortman to
sort through the web of conflicting anthropological theories,
disjunctive material artifacts and complex linguistic, cultural and
genetic clues to find a scientific validation for what the indigenous
Tewa people have been telling us all along about their ethnogenesis,
i.e. where they came from.  In his lecture at the Telluride Historical
Museum this spring, Ortman laid out his case quite elegantly. And his
prize-winning new book (derived from his Ph. D. thesis) assembles all
the intricate details -- Winds from the North: Tewa Origins and
Historical Anthropology (Univ. of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 2012)
For years anthropologists were mystified because, although there was a
sudden population increase in the Rio Grande region right around the
time Mesa Verde and Chaco were depopulated, none of the cultural
artifacts from Mesa Verde culture (pottery styles, architectural
styles, etc.) ever appeared in the Rio Grande region.

<p>
The “abandonment” of Mesa Verde and the formation of the Rio Grande
Pueblos represent two classic events in North American
prehistory. Yet, despite a century of research, no consensus has been
reached on precisely how, or even if, these two events were
related. In this landmark study, Scott Ortman proposes a novel and
compelling solution to this problem through an investigation of the
genetic, linguistic, and cultural heritage of the Tewa Pueblo people
of New Mexico.

<p>
Integrating data and methods from human biology, linguistics,
archaeology, and cultural anthropology, Ortman shows that a striking
social transformation took place as Mesa Verde people moved to the Rio
Grande, such that the resulting ancestral Tewa culture was a unique
hybrid of ideas and practices from various sources. While addressing
several long-standing questions in American archaeology, Winds from
the North also serves as a methodological guidebook, including new
approaches to integrating archaeology and language based on cognitive
science research. As such, it will be of interest to researchers
throughout the social and human sciences.

**Nucleosynthesis**<p>

From <a href="https://www.earthdate.org/files/000/003/619/EarthDate_353_C.pdf" target="_blank">ErthDate.org</a>

<p>

Nearly everything in the universe was made by stars.
Stars are fueled by nuclear fusion. They fuse atoms of the
lightest element, with only one proton—hydrogen—into the
next lightest element, with two protons—helium.
In every fusion reaction, they’re creating an atom of a new
element.
<p>

When they’ve used up their hydrogen, they begin to
fuse the remaining helium into a heavier element, carbon.
<p>

Then they’ll fuse that into oxygen and progressively
heavier elements.
<p>

Each of these fusion reactions is less energetic, so by the
time the star is fusing iron, it’s nearing the end of its life.
<p>

The star may soon explode in a supernova, dispersing the
elements it created into other solar systems where they
may be used to form planets.
<p>

After a supernova, the star may continue to exist as a
black hole or an extremely dense neutron star. In this
environment, elements like iron can capture free neutrons
to form still heavier elements like silver, gold or plutonium.
The atoms that came together to form Earth 4.5 billion years
ago were once part of stars that lived and died long before.
<p>

Almost every atom in your body is billions of years old,
from the calcium in your bones to the carbon in your DNA,
recycled countless times.
<p>

That song was right: we are stardust. Stars made the
elements that make us.

<p>
Any attempt to speak without speaking any particular language is not
more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no

<p>Thus every living and healthy religion has a
marked idiosyncrasy. Its power consists in its special and surprising
message and in the bias which that revelation gives to life. The
vistas it opens and the mysteries it propounds are another world to

"mudra":

<b>Dogen on the Cosmic Mudra</b>

“When one displays the buddha mudra with one’s whole body and mind…”
<p>

This “one” is a translation of hito – it means a person. He didn’t say
“if a buddha sits in zazen” or “if an enlightened person sits in
zazen,” but any person, and even for a short time. Even if we sit as a
very beginner for the first time, the same thing happens in our
zazen. Buddha mudra is a translation of butsu in. Earlier, Dōgen used
the expression ichi butsu shin in; this is the same thing. This in is
mudra, ichi is of course one, so this means, “one buddha mind mudra.”

<p>

You may know the word “mudra.” [shows mudra with hands]. When we sit
in zazen we hold our hands like this and we make an oval with the
thumbs. This is called hokkai gyo in; in English, “cosmic mudra.” This
means that two sides or duality becomes one, one form, or one
circle. In Buddhism, there are many different mudras or ways to hold
the hands depending upon which buddha is being described or
depicted. Each mudra has its own meaning. But here, this kanji for
mudra means in English a stamp or seal. A seal is when you write a
letter, put it in an envelope and seal it with something, or put a
stamp on it to show by whom this letter is written. Stamps or seals
are very important in Chinese and Japanese culture. On certain
paintings or calligraphy, if someone’s seal is there, it is a
certification that this painting or calligraphy was done by this
person. Even today in Japanese society we have a stamp or a seal, and
we use it to make legal interactions. This stamp is like a signature
in American society.

__Mythology of Puget Sound__<br>
by Herman Haeberlin
<p>

The following collection of tales from Puget Sound was made by Dr.
 Herman Haeberlin on an expedition which was made possible by the
 generosity of Mr. Homer E. Sargent of Pasadena, California. Unfortu-
 nately Dr. Haeberlin died before he had time to work out his material,
 and the tales have been written out from his notebooks by Erna Gunther
 Spier.
<p>

 The first group (pp. 372-391) are transformer tales which belong
 to the group characteristic of Vancouver Island and Puget Sound. The
 name Hdldk" by which the transformer is called by the Skagit may be
 related to the name Xals or Xils by which he is known on southern
 Vancouver Island. In a number of cases tales belonging to different
 cycles, or isolated tales, have been incorporated into this cycle. Thus the
 first tale of our series describing the origin of the transformer is not known
 in this form from the Gulf of Georgia (see F. Boas : Mythology of the
 Tsimshian, RBAE 31, pp. 586 et seq.). The Star-Husband story has also
 been made part of this cycle.

 Mink and Raven who are important figures in the origin myths of
 the northern coast tribes, appear here also in a number of tales. The
 modern version of the origin of daylight (which is identified with the
 clock), is rather peculiar.

 The tribes of the east coast of Puget Sound represented here have
 been deeply influenced by those of the interior, as is manifested by the

__How the Sons of Mink and Raven Stole Light__

<p>
(Skagit : told by Charlie's wife)
<p>

In the beginning of the world the people lived in a village.
one son and Mink had one son. They said, "Let us train our children."
Where Mink and Raven lived it was dark, but in the east there was
light. They agreed to train their sons to be strong young men.

<p> Young Mink and young Raven practised running and became good
runners.  They came home and told their fathers that they were good
runners so their fathers told them to steal light from the people in
the East.

<p>In the East there is a light country. When they came to a
house in this country Mink went inside, but Raven stayed without. Mink
disguised himself as an old man before he entered the house. The
people let him come in and lie down for he acted as if he could not
walk. When night came he tried to steal the light. He got up and
touched the light. It flickered. The people woke up and asked where
Mink was. 
<p>

But Mink quickly got under the covers and the people did not find out anything.
The next night Mink tried the same thing again. The light flickered
again and the people woke up and looked to see whether Mink was in
bed. Again Mink got under the covers. Mink did this the third night and
the same thing happened. The fourth night he made up his mind to
get the light this time.

<p>
Raven had been waiting outside at some distance.

<p>Mink now acted like
a young man again and caught the light quickly and ran away with it.The
people woke up and saw that Mink was gone. They followed him. Mink
ran until he was almost tired out. Then he shouted to Raven to take the
light. Raven took it and ran on.

<p> The people followed Mink and Raven
until they reached the dark country. The people of the dark country
saw the light coming and their country became light. Old Raven and old
Mink were proud of their sons for having stolen the light from the country
in the east. Old Raven wanted to have the light all the time, but the
other people wanted it to go down from time to time. The wish of the
latter prevailed.

"minkAndTheClock":
`
__How Mink Got Daylight (Skagit)__:
<p>
In olden times it was dark all the time and the only light was the
moon. But there was daylight in the east. Mink and his younger brother
Sole and his cousin Raven talked about the man who had daylight and
set out eastward to get it. They took fifteen strings of dried clams with
them. They went as far as possible in a canoe. Then Mink left the two
others and gave them the fifteen strings of clams which were to last
fifteen days. He went off alone and made himself so old that he could
hardly walk. As soon as Mink had left,  Raven sent Sole away and in
three days ate all the clams.
<p>

Mink came to the man who had the daylight and who was the chief
of the tribe. Mink told the man, " I am the oldest brother of your father,
in time of war the people took me away with them. Now I have come
back to see you. " The man with the daylight believed what Mink said.
Meanwhile Mink was watching how the man controlled the sun. It was
like a clock. The man called his people together and told what Mink
had said.
<p>

There were three different keys used in winding the clock and Mink
found out how to work them. Then while the people were still asleep
Mink stole the clock. He took off the mask that made him look like an
old man. One of the people saw Mink go away. They chased him. Just as
Mink was tired out he met Raven who took the daylight and ran on.
The little boy Sole had the canoe in readiness. All three jumped aboard
and paddled away. The people could not follow because they had no
canoes.
<p>
Mink had the clock which was the sun wrapped up. He went t
grandmother's where he lived. She said, " What is Mink doing ? He co
not get daylight. " Mink made the sun work and it became daylight.

<p>
The chief's daughter saw the daylight come. She went to Mink's house
and listened to the clock striking. The girl went to her father and said,
" Your cousin has secured the daylight. " Mink was a slave (footnote 1: among the Skagit.
They captured him east of the Mountains) before but
now the girl called him chief. There were two chiefs in this tribe, one
was the father of this girl. The one chief said to the other, " We will give
a feast and let Mink tell how he got the daylight. " They called him chief
too. At first Mink said that he did not want to be chief and stayed a
slave. He locked himself up in his house and the chief sent his daughter
to listen all night. Mink knew that the girl was outside. He went out.
The girl wanted to marry him and followed him indoors. She watched
him wind up the clock with the three keys in the morning. After winding
with the third key the sun rose.

<p>
Mink said to the girl, " Go to your father and make him call all the
people together. " The people came and Mink said to them, "If you are
going to call me slave all the time then I shall take the daylight back
to the east, but if you call me chief I will leave the daylight here." The
chief put the matter up to the people. They voted that Mink should
become chief in place of the old chief. The old chief gave his daughter
to Mink and said, " Bring Mink into the house and he will now be our
head man... (footnote 2: this tale is unfinished)

`
<b>A system of symbols</b><br>

<div>A religion is a <b>system of symbols
which acts to </b>establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods
and motivations in
men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
clothing those conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the
moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.</div>


<br>
Such a tremendous weight is being put on the term "symbol" here
that our first move must be to decide with some precision what we are
going to mean by it. This is no easy task, for, rather like "culture,"
"symbol" has been used to refer to a great variety of things, often a
number of them at the same time.
<p>
In some hands it is used for anything which signifies something else
to someone: dark clouds are the symbolic precursors of an on-coming
rain. In others it is used only for explicitly conventional signs of one
sort or another: a red flag is a symbol of danger, a white of surrender.
In others it is confined to something which expresses in an oblique and
figurative manner that which cannot be stated in a direct and literal one,
so that there are symbols in poetry but not in science, and symbolic
logic is misnamed. In yet others, however, it is used for any object, act,
event, quality, or relation which serves as a vehicle .for a conception—
the conception is the symbol's "meaning"—and that is the approach I
shall follow here.  (See 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Langer" target="_blank">Langer, Philosophy in a New Key</a>.)
<p>

The number 6, written, imagined, laid out as a row of stones, or even
punched into the program tapes of a computer, is a symbol. But so also
is the Cross, talked about, visualized, shaped worriedly in air or
fondly fingered at the neck, the expanse of painted canvas called
"Guernica" or the bit of painted stone called a churinga, the word
"reality," or even the morpheme "-ing." They are all symbols, or at
least symbolic elements, because they are tangible formulations of
notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms,
concrete embodiments of ideas, attitudes, judgments, longings, or
beliefs.  To undertake the study of cultural activity—activity in
which symbolism forms the positive content—is thus not to abandon
social analysis for a Platonic cave of shadows, to enter into a
mentalistic world of introspective psychology or, worse, speculative
philosophy, and wander there forever in a haze of "Cognitions,"
"Affections," "Conations," and other elusive entities. Cultural acts,
the construction, apprehension, and utilization of symbolic forms, are
social events like any other; they are as public as marriage and as
observable as agriculture.
<p>
They are not, however, exactly the same thing; or, more precisely,
the symbolic dimension of social events is, like the psychological, itself
theoretically abstractable from those events as empirical totalities.
There is still, to paraphrase a remark of Kenneth Burke's, a difference
between building a house and drawing up a plan for building a house,
and reading a poem about having children by marriage is not quite the
same thing as having children by marriage.
<p>

Even though the building of the house may proceed under the guidance
of the plan or—a less likely occurrence—the having of children may be
motivated by a reading of the poem, there is something to be said for
not confusing our traffic with symbols with our traffic with objects
or human beings, for these latter are not in themselves symbols,
however often they may function as such.
<p>

No matter how deeply interfused the cultural, the social, and the
psychological may be in the everyday life of houses, farms, poems, and
marriages, it is useful to distinguish them in analysis, and, so
doing, to isolate the generic traits of each against the normalized
background of the other two. So far as culture patterns, that is,
systems or complexes of symbols, are concerned, the generic trait
which is of first importance for us here is that they are extrinsic
sources of information. By "extrinsic," I mean only that—unlike genes,
for example—they lie outside the boundaries of the individual organism
as such in that intersubjective world of common understandings into
which all human individuals are born, in which they pursue their
separate careers, and which they leave persisting behind them after
they die.

<p>By "sources of information," I mean only that—like
genes—they provide a blueprint or template in terms of which processes
external to themselves can be given a definite form. As the order of
bases in a strand of DNA forms a coded program, a set of instructions,
or a recipe, for the synthesis of the structurally complex proteins
which shape organic functioning, so culture patterns provide such
programs for the institution of the social and psychological processes
which shape public behavior. Though the sort of information and the
mode of its transmission are vastly different in the two cases, this
comparison of gene and symbol is more than a strained analogy of the
familiar "social heredity" sort. It is actually a substantial
relationship, for it is precisely because of the fact that genetically
programmed processes are so highly generalized in men, as compared
with lower animals, that culturally programmed ones are so important; only because
human behavior is so loosely determined by intrinsic sources of information that extrinsic sources are so vital. To build a dam a beaver
needs only an appropriate site and the proper materials—his mode of
procedure is shaped by his physiology.

<p>But man, whose genes are silent on the building trades, needs also
a conception of what it is to build a dam, a conception he can get
only from some symbolic source—a blueprint, a textbook, or a string of
speech by someone who already knows how dams are built—or, of course,
from manipulating graphic or linguistic elements in such a way as to
attain for himself a conception of what dams are and how they are
built.  This point is sometimes put in the form of an argument that
cultural patterns are "models," that they are sets of symbols whose
relations to one another "model" relations among entities, processes
or what-haveyou in physical, organic, social, or psychological systems
by "paralleling," "imitating," or "simulating" them.8

<p> The term "model" has, however, two senses—an "of" sense and a
"for" sense—and though these are but aspects of the same basic concept
they are very much worth distinguishing for analytic purposes. In the
first, what is stressed is the manipulation of symbol structures so as
to bring them, more or less closely, into parallel with the
pre-established nonsymbolic system, as when we grasp how dams work by
developing a theory of hydraulics or constructing a flow chart. The
theory or chart models physical relationships in such a way—that is,
by expressing their structure in synoptic form—as to render them
apprehensible; it is a model of "reality." In the second, what is
stressed is the manipulation of the nonsymbolic systems in terms of
the relationships expressed in the symbolic, as when we construct a
dam according to the specifications implied in an hydraulic theory or
the conclusions drawn from a flow chart. Here, the theory is a model
under whose guidance physical relationships are organized: it is a
model for "reality." For psychological and social systems, and for
cultural models that we would not ordinarily refer to as "theories,"
but rather as "doctrines," "melodies," or "rites," the case is in no
way different. Unlike genes, and other nonsymbolic information
sources, which are only models for, not models of, culture patterns
have an intrinsic double aspect: they give meaning, that is, objective
conceptual form, to social and psychological reality both by shaping
themselves to it and by shaping it to themselves.

<p> ther sorts of significative forms. Models for are found, as the
gene example suggests, through the whole order of nature; for wherever
there is a communication of pattern, such programs are, in simple
logic, required. Among animals, imprint learning is perhaps the most
striking example, because what such learning involves is the automatic
presentation of an appropriate sequence of behavior by a model animal
in the presence of a learning animal which serves, equally
automatically, to call out and stabilize a certain set of responses
genetically built into the learning animal.9 The communicative dance
of two bees, one of which has found nectar and the other of which
seeks it, is another, somewhat different, more complexly coded,
example.10 Craik has even suggested that the thin trickle of water
which first finds its way down from a mountain spring to the sea and
smooths a little channel for the greater volume of water that follows
after it plays a sort of model for function.11 But models
of—linguistic, graphic, mechanical, natural, etc., processes which
function not to provide sources of information in terms of which other
processes can be patterned, but to represent those patterned processes
as such, to express their structure in an alternative medium—are much
rarer and may perhaps be confined, among living animals, to man. The
perception of the structural congruence between one set of processes,
activities, relations, entities, and so on, and another set for which
it acts as a program, so that the program can be taken as a
representation, or conception—a symbol—of the programmed, is the
essence of human thought. The intertransposability of models for and
models of which symbolic formulation makes possible is the distinctive
characteristic of our mentality.

<b>Moods and Motivations</b><p>

<div>A religion is a system of symbols
which acts to <b>establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods
and motivations in
men </b>by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
clothing those conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the
moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.</div>

So far as religious symbols and symbol systems are concerned this
intertransposability is clear. The endurance, courage, independence,
perseverance, and passionate willfulness in which the vision quest
practices the Plains Indian are the same flamboyant virtues by which
he attempts to live: while achieving a sense of revelation he
stabilizes a sense of direction. The consciousness of defaulted
obligation, secreted guilt, and, when a confession is obtained, public
shame in which Manus' seance rehearses him are the same sentiments
that underlie the sort of duty ethic by which his property-conscious
society is maintained: the gaining of an absolution involves the
forging of a conscience.13 And the same self-discipline which rewards
a Javanese mystic staring fixedly into the flame of a lamp with what
he takes to be an intimation of divinity drills him in that rigorous
control of emotional expression which is necessary to a man who would
follow a quietistic style of life.14 Whether one sees the conception
of a personal guardian spirit, a family tutelary, or an immanent God
as synoptic formulations of the character of reality or as templates
for producing reality with such a character seems largely arbitrary, a
matter of which aspect, the model of or model for, one wants for the
moment to bring into focus. The concrete symbols involved--one or
another mythological figure materializing in the wilderness, the skull
of the deceased household head hanging censoriously in the rafters, or
a disembodied "voice in the stillness" soundlessly chanting enigmatic
classical poetry--point in either direction. They both express the
world's climate and shape it.

<p> 

They shape it by inducing in the worshipper a certain distinctive set
of dispositions (tendencies, capacities, propensities, skills, habits,
liabilities, pronenesses) which lend a chronic character to the flow
of his activity and the quality of his experience. A disposition
describes not an activity or an occurrence but a probability of an
activity being performed or an occurrence occurring in certain
circumstances: "When a cow is said to be a ruminant, or a man is said
to be a cigarette-smoker, it is not being said that the cow is
ruminating now or that the man is smoking a cigarette now. To be a
ruminant is to tend to ruminate from time to time, and to be a
cigarette-smoker is to be in the habit of smoking cigarettes."15
Similarly, to be pious is not to be performing something we would call
an act of piety, but to be liable to perform such acts. So, too, with
the Plains Indian's bravura, the Manus' compunctiousness, or the
Javanese's quietism, which, in their contexts, form the substance of
piety. The virtue of this sort of view of what are usually called
"mental traits" or, if the Cartesianism is unavowed, "psychological
forces" (both unobjectionable enough terms in themselves) is that it
gets them out of any dim and inaccessible realm of private sensation
into that same well-lit world of observables in which reside the
brittleness of glass, the inflammability of paper, and, to return to
the metaphor, the dampness of England.
<p>

So far as religious activities are concerned (and learning a myth by
heart is as much a religious activity as detaching one's finger at the
knuckle), two somewhat different sorts of disposition are induced by
them: moods and motivations.

<p> 

A motivation is a persisting tendency, a chronic inclination to
perform certain sorts of acts and experience certain sorts of feeling
in certain sorts of situations, the "sorts" being commonly very
heterogenous and rather ill-defined classes in all three cases:
<p>

On hearing that a man is vain [i.e., motivated by vanity] we expect
him to behave in certain ways, namely to talk a lot about himself, to
cleave to the society of the eminent, to reject criticisms, to seek
the footlights and to disengage himself from conversations about the
merits of others. We expect him to indulge in roseate daydreams about
his own successes, to avoid recalling past failures and to plan for
his own advancement. To be vain is to tend to act in these and
innumerable other kindred ways. Certainly we also expect the vain man
to feel certain pangs and flutters in certain situations; we expect
him to have an acute sinking feeling when an eminent person forgets
his name, and to feel buoyant of heart and light of toe on hearing of
the misfortunes of his rivals. But feelings of pique and buoyancy are
not more directly indicative of vanity than are public acts of
boasting or private acts of daydreaming.16
<p>

Similarly for any motivations. As a motive, "flamboyant courage"
consists in such enduring propensities as to fast in the wilderness,
to conduct solitary raids on enemy camps, and to thrill to the thought
of counting coup. "Moral circumspection" consists in such ingrained
tendencies as to honor onerous promises, to confess secret sins in the
face of severe public disapproval, and to feel guilty when vague and
generalized accusations are made at seances. And "dispassionate
tranquility" consists in such persistent inclinations as to maintain
one's poise come hell or high water, to experience distaste in the
presence of even moderate emotional displays, and to indulge in
contentless contemplations of featureless objects. Motives are thus
neither acts (that is, intentional behaviors) nor feelings, but
liabilities to perform particular classes of act or have particular
classes of feeling. And when we say that a man is religious, that is,
motivated by religion, this is at least part--though only part--of
what we mean.

<p> 

Another part of what we mean is that he has, when properly stimulated,
a susceptibility to fall into certain moods, moods we sometimes lump
together under such covering terms as "reverential," "solemn," or
"worshipful." Such generalized rubrics actually conceal, however, the
enormous empirical variousness of the dispositions involved, and, in
fact, tend to assimilate them to the unusually grave tone of most of
our own religious life. The moods that sacred symbols induce, at
different times and in different places, range from exultation to
melancholy, from self-confidence to self-pity, from an incorrigible
playfulness to a bland listlessness--to say nothing of the erogenous
power of so many of the world's myths and rituals. No more than there
is a single sort of motivation one can call piety is there a single
sort of mood one can call worshipful.

 
<p>

The major difference between moods and motivations is that where the
latter are, so to speak, vectorial qualities, the former are merely
scalar. Motives have a directional cast, they describe a certain
overall course, gravitate toward certain, usually temporary,
consummations. But moods vary only as to intensity: they go
nowhere. They spring from certain circumstances but they are
responsive to no ends. Like fogs, they just settle and lift; like
scents, suffuse and evaporate. When present they are totalistic: if
one is sad everything and everybody seems dreary; if one is gay,
everything and everybody seems splendid. Thus, though a man can be
vain, brave, willful, and independent at the same time, he can't very
well be playful and listless, or exultant and melancholy, at the same
time.17 Further, where motives persist for more or less extended
periods of time, moods merely recur with greater or lesser frequency,
coming and going for what are often quite unfathomable reasons. But
perhaps the most important difference, so far as we are concerned,
between moods and motivations is that motivations are "made
meaningful" with reference to the ends toward which they are conceived
to conduce, whereas moods are "made meaningful" with reference to the
conditions from which they are conceived to spring. We interpret
motives in terms of their consummations, but we interpret moods in
terms of their sources. We say that a person is industrious because he
wishes to succeed; we say that a person is worried because he is
conscious of the hanging threat of nuclear holocaust. And this is no
less the case when the interpretations are ultimate. Charity becomes
Christian charity when it is enclosed in a conception of God's
purposes; optimism is Christian optimism when it is grounded in a
particular conception of God's nature. The assiduity of the Navaho
finds its rationale in a belief that, since "reality" operates
mechanically, it is coercible; their chronic fearfulness finds its
rationale in a conviction that, however "reality" operates, it is both
enormously powerful and terribly dangerous.

"butler-gender-trouble":
`
Gender Trouble</h4>

The term gender performativity was first coined by American
philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler in their 1990 book
Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. In the
book, Butler sets out to criticize what they consider to be an
outdated perception of gender. This outdated perception, according to
Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal
constraints that label gender as binary.

<p>In scrutinizing gender,
Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which they unite the
concepts of performativity and gender. In chapter one, Butler
introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in
stating that "gender proves to be performance—that is, constituting
the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a
doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist
the deed".
<p>

Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the
terms gender performance and gender performativity. In a 2011
interview, Butler stated it this way, in <u>Your Behavior Creates Your Gender</u> (2011)


<blockquote>

When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken
on a role; we're acting in some way... To say that gender is
performative is a little different, because for something to be
performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and
walk and speak and talk in ways that consolidate an impression of
being a man or being a woman... We act as if that being of a man or
that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or something
that's simply true about us, a fact about us. Actually, it's a
phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the
time, so to say gender is performative is to say that nobody really is
a gender from the start.[68]
</blockquote>


Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of
acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal
norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of
performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead,
what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of
an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing
the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what
produces the individual.

wikipedia</a>

In psychology and ethology, imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive
learning (learning occurring at a particular age or a particular life
stage) that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of
behaviour. <p>

It was first used to describe situations in which an animal
or person learns the characteristics of some stimulus, which is
therefore said to be "imprinted" onto the subject. Imprinting is
hypothesized to have a critical period.

<p>
In humans, where much of our understanding and skill are learned,
and relatively little is inherent - like beaver dam construction, for instance,
or the bee dance - that imprinting, of many kinds, shape a significant
amount of the human perception, and human life.

</ul>

<blockquote>

Is a god, or any divine power, only a mirage of the human-made
political structures that oppress us? This understanding of religion,
popularized by 19th-century thinkers like Karl Marx and Émile
Durkheim, has become received wisdom among the anthropologists and
sociologists studying the origins and functions of religious life. We
sense that we live under forces of authority that constrain us, and
yet we cannot precisely locate or understand them. Needing to give
some shape or form to this coercion, we project it onto the clouds,
fashioning heavenly beings that are ultimately deifications of the
human state. “Religion is realistic,” Durkheim noted; it corresponds
to our social realities and reinforces them.
<p>

Yet the existence of societies without chiefs or kings, or any
vertical political organization, challenges this picture. In
communities that traditionally recognized no rulers or government,
from Tierra del Fuego to the Central Arctic to the Philippines, we
still find complex concepts of celestial hierarchies, metahuman
authorities, and bureaucracies of deities and spirits with no
correspondence to the human social order. Where do these ideas come
from, which reflect no living conditions on the ground? How is it that
notions of the state seem to be anticipated by cosmology before they
are realized in society?
<p>

These questions lie at the heart of Marshall Sahlins’s final book, The
New Science of the Enchanted Universe: An Anthropology of Most of
Humanity. Across most cultures, Sahlins observes, human life unfolds
in continuous reference to other beings—supreme gods and minor
deities, ancestral spirits, demons, indwelling souls in animals and
plants—who act as the intimate, everyday agents of human success or
ruin, whether in agriculture, hunting, procreation, or politics. These
not-quite humans, or metapersons, can be found across all landscapes,
from the Chewong “leaf people” in the Malay Peninsula to the Greenland
Inuits, who had the idea that spirits animate each human joint and
knuckle. Indigenous communities possess empirical knowledge about
these spirit worlds, yet anthropologists often use the language of
“belief”—or worse, “folk belief”—to describe them, an approach loaded
with their own disbelief. Rejecting the obscurant category of
“belief,” Sahlins asks: What if we saw metapersons as worthy of a
science of their own? If we examine them as a ubiquitous global
presence, and attempt to tease out general theories about their role
in human political and economic life, what would this new science
teach us?
<p>

Published posthumously, The New Science of the Enchanted Universe is
riveting, and this is in part because Sahlins writes with an
incantatory, late-style openness to the existence of metapersons—just
as he began to turn into an ancestral spirit himself. In the late
autumn of 2020, Sahlins had become paralyzed after a fall; not long
before his 90th birthday, he slipped into a dissociative state and was
given days to live. Yet he soon surfaced from the hereafter,
determined to finish the manuscript. Having lost the use of both
hands, over the next few months he dictated it to his son, the
historian Peter Sahlins, and completed it a month before his
death. The book (“my swan song,” as he calls it in the preface) is
electrified by ideas—of human finitude and eternity, the interlacing
of the political, the enchanted, and the divine—that Sahlins, even
near his end, could not lay to rest.
<p>

If Marshall Sahlins had a faith of his own, it was humor. Born in 1930
in Chicago, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Sahlins was raised
in a secular household, although his family counted among its
ancestors the 18th-century Jewish mystic Ba’al Shem Tov, the founder
of Hasidic Judaism, who was famous for his laughter during a Passover
seder. This contagious, charismatic wit was something of a family
inheritance—his brother Bernard Sahlins later became a comedian, while
Marshall became known for a mix of mischief and polemic that ignited
conversations as well as the written page. He studied anthropology at
the University of Michigan, sailed through a PhD at Columbia in two
years, and then returned to Michigan to teach.
<p>

In those years, Sahlins was an evolutionary materialist, interested in
how cultures evolve alongside technological progress. His
dissertation, Social Stratification in Polynesia, took this approach,
looking at how cultural difference arises through environmental and
economic factors. Yet by the mid-1960s, the United States’ disastrous
war in Vietnam had shattered the technological determinism that
Sahlins was taught in school and revealed to him how ways of
understanding cultural progress are often at the behest of empire. As
Sahlins recalled in an interview, he became interested in what he
called “the indigenization of modernity,” the ways in which peoples
attempt “to engage the encroaching ‘World System’ in something even
more encompassing—their own system of the world.” He had observed this
phenomenon during fieldwork on the island of Moala in Fiji in 1955,
when he studied how chiefly lineages adapted to new orders of power.
<p>

The 1960s were a transformative period for Sahlins, intensifying his
left-leaning commitments and sharpening his political activism. Amid
the upheavals in the United States and Vietnam, Sahlins detected “a
clear and simple law of revolution”: that it is the rulers, not the
revolutionaries, who undermine a society’s culture and principles of
government. “It is from deep traditional values that the opposition
draws its outrage—and in defense of them, takes to the streets,” he
later reflected in a collection of political essays, Culture in
Practice. At an all-night protest in Ann Arbor in 1965, Sahlins led
the first anti–Vietnam War “teach-in” and is often credited as the
inventor of the concept, which took college campuses by storm. Soon
after, he organized a national teach-in of thousands of students in
Washington, D.C., and the following year he flew to Vietnam, where he
taped a set of darkly absurd dialogues with American
operatives—“hard-headed surrealists,” as he called them.
<p>

In 1968, Sahlins moved to Paris to participate in the famed
anthropological laboratoire of Claude Lévi-Strauss, and he also
witnessed the mass student protests and workers’ strikes that
year. Inspired by the collective uprising, he sought to adapt
Lévi-Strauss’s theory of structuralism, of how symbols, patterns, and
binaries form the building blocks and hidden laws that structure human
thought. What happens when these structures collide with a
revolutionary present? How do individuals become agents of historical
change? Amid the labor strikes, Sahlins was also contemplating how
leisurely life must have been in the Paleolithic period. In his essay
“The Original Affluent Society,” he argued that hunter-gatherers lived
not in hardscrabble misery, on the edge of starvation, but in
prosperity.
<p>

“There is,” Sahlins wrote, “a Zen road to affluence, departing from
premises somewhat different from our own: that human material wants
are finite and few.” Among pre-agricultural tribes, Sahlins
calculated, food acquisition took only three to five hours per day,
leaving plenty of time for feasting, recreation, and sleep. In
contrast, “the market-industrial system institutes scarcity, in a
manner completely unparalleled,” as it requires insufficiency as the
foundation of all economic activity. Poverty, Sahlins wrote, is above
all “a relation between people. Poverty is a social status. As such,
it is the invention of civilization,” which forges tributary
relationships between classes. Sahlins developed these ideas in Stone
Age Economics (1972), a book that, half a century later, remains a
prophetic call for degrowth amid the current climate collapse.
<p>

For Sahlins, Indigenous cultures offered profound counterpoints for
how humans might live, a theme he continued to develop after his move
in 1973 to the University of Chicago, where he remained for nearly 50
years. In Islands of History, he began to investigate how divinity
intersects with cultural structures and historic events—most
notoriously through the fate of James Cook. In 1779, when Captain Cook
landed on Hawaii, he was reportedly hailed as the god Lono, and a
rapturous crowd of thousands offered him sacrifices. Yet when Cook
stepped ashore a second time, after his ship was damaged in a storm,
he was slain; Sahlins argued that this was because Cook was
inadvertently playing out the script of a myth held by the islanders
that when the god returns, he must act out a battle with the king. To
the anthropologist Gananath Obeyesekere, Sahlins’s analysis was
exoticizing and patronizing, for it denied Hawaiians common sense: Why
would Polynesians mistake a Yorkshireman for their own god? For
Obeyesekere, what he called “practical rationality” was universal,
while Sahlins argued for its cultural specificity in his 1995
book-length reply, How “Natives” Think (About Captain Cook, for
Example). On Hawaii, Sahlins wrote, “politics appears as the
continuation of cosmogonic war by other means.”
<p>

These ideas deepened through Sahlins’s ongoing dialogue with a
luminous former student, the author and activist David Graeber, who
died less than a year before his teacher. In 2017, Sahlins and Graeber
published the monumental On Kings, in which they argued that the
structures of sacred kingship have never vanished from modern politics
or our institutions of “popular” sovereignty. Throughout On Kings,
supra-human beings continuously appear, ever setting “the terms and
conditions of human existence.” One even appears on its cover: the
frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan, depicting the crowned
monarch rising above the human landscape, his body made of myriad tiny
persons who blur together like a scaly coat of armor. The image
reveals how metapersons have penetrated the conceptualization of the
state in Western traditions often deemed the apex of rational, secular
thought. The essence of political power, Sahlins and Graeber wrote,
“is the ability to act as if one were a god; to step outside the
confines of the human, and return to rain favor, or destruction.” It
must have been while he was writing On Kings that the metapersons
approached Sahlins and requested, or demanded, that he devote an
entire book to them.

<p>
The New Science of the Enchanted Universe takes as its starting point
perhaps the earliest cultural revolution, that of the “Axial Age,” the
period between the eighth and third centuries BCE in which the
civilizations of Greece, the Near East, India, and China underwent a
seismic shift. Notions of divinity, Sahlins tells us, moved “from an
immanent presence in human activity to a transcendental ‘other world’
of its own reality,” creating the foundations for the Vedic, Buddhist,
Judaic, and (later) Christian and Islamic religions. In the
disenchanting exodus of transcendence, the high gods and spirits
evacuated to the upper echelons of the sky, “leaving the earth alone
to humans, now free to create their own institutions by their own
means and lights.” In societies that remained enchanted, the legions
of metapersons continued to be “the decisive agents of human weal and
woe,” and what we would call “culture” was still not considered “a
human thing.” In contrast, in the transcendental societies, culture
became humankind’s own invention, a domain entirely under our control.
<p>


In what Sahlins calls the “Second Axial Age,” rooted in the doctrinal
wars and imperialist conquests of the early modern period from the
15th through the 19th centuries, European civilization forged a set of
abstract, differentiated spheres—“religion,” “politics,” “economics,”
“culture,” “science,” and “nature”—that created further distance from
the once-enchanted cosmos. The realm of the economy came to be seen as
the base of the pyramid of quotidian life, while divinity moved from
being the infrastructure to the superstructure. With each axial turn
came a host of intractable theological dilemmas; throughout the book,
the immanentist perspective emerges as the most intuitive, as it
escapes the perennial problem of theodicy—of why an infinitely
benevolent Almighty would cause so much harm to mortals, or even get
involved in their minutiae—that plagues transcendentalism.
<p>

In The New Science, Sahlins attempts to convene a vivid conference of
metapersons and let them speak, without imposing the distorting
transcendentalist categories upon them. These familiar binaries—of
“natural” versus “supernatural,” “material” versus “spiritual,”
“secular” versus “religious”—make no sense, he argues, as a way to
understand the halibut master of species that brokers deals with
Kwakiutl fishermen in the Pacific Northwest. For ancient Sumerians,
minerals like salt were alive, with opinions of their own. BaKongo
people had a practice of shaving the head to keep it clear and smooth
“for spirits that might want to land there,” as the anthropologist
Wyatt MacGaffey reported. It is not surprising, given the huge range
of ways to suffer, that demons tend to be the most diverse and heavily
populated class of metahumans: The Chewong recognize 27 different
types. “All that exists lives,” a Siberian Chukchee shaman told the
Russian ethnographer Waldemar Bogoras. “The lamp walks around. The
walls of the house have voices of their own…. Even the shadows on the
wall constitute definite tribes and have their own country, where they
live in huts and subsist by hunting.”
<p>

The Chukchee, descended from nomadic hunter-gatherers, are among what
Sahlins calls the “so-called tribes without rulers” who historically
lacked vertical political structures yet knew entrenched cosmic forms
of authority. In the early 20th century, the shaman described to
Bogoras how they were subjugated to hosts of invisible, mercenary
spirits with whom they had to forge alliances or pay ransoms for
protection. One might theorize that cosmic polities are modeled, if
not around earthly political coercion, then after patriarchy within
the unit of the human family itself. Yet even in communities that
prize familial relationships of equality, Sahlins notes, such as the
Buid of Mindoro in the Philippines, we find strongly hierarchical
concepts of the metahuman world that in no way reflect their equitable
mode of life. Sahlins particularly focuses on geographically isolated
groups uninfluenced by transcendentalist missionaries, such as the
subarctic Naskapi in what is now northern Canada, who acquiesce to no
authority except the overlord Moose-Fly. Flanked by his avatars, the
stinging moose-flies that appear during the summer salmon-fishing
season, Moose-Fly rules over the fish tribes upon whom Naskapi life
depends. Humans must obey his laws, such as never making fun of a fish
for its big eyes.
<p>

“The state of nature had the nature of the state,” as Sahlins put it
in a companion essay in the volume Sacred Kingship in World History
(2022). If immanence was the original human condition out of which
transcendentalist civilizations arose, it follows that a hierarchical
cosmology was already in place from the beginning—almost as if
originating from a source that preexisted human life. This possibility
is furthered by the existence of utterly random, bizarre laws that
seem to serve no human function (the United States has many). In The
New Science, Sahlins compares the Inuit “rules of life” recorded in
Baffin Land in the 1920s—“If a woman sees a whale, she must point to
it with her middle finger”—to an ancient Akkadian list of
commandments, including that one must never point at a lamp. Even
where there is no clear moral content, what is at stake is obedience
to the higher metapersonal powers, in a deference “even better served
by ‘irrationality,’” a pattern replicated in the whims of autocrats
today. If “power descends from heaven to earth,” Sahlins writes,
“human political power is necessarily and quintessentially hubris, the
appropriation of divinity in one form or another.” The charisma of
politicians is always given by the gods, such as the mana handed down
to legions of Melanesian chiefs. In his essay, Sahlins touches upon
the interesting point that hubris, or overstepping the boundaries
between the human and the divine, also underlies structures of class,
with elites often seen as possessing or appropriating spirit-power. In
turn, any emancipatory movement must mobilize the metahuman as “the
necessary precedent of political action.”
<p>

Sahlins has an eye for profound, poetic details and writes with a deep
empathy, as someone who is constantly moved by the ideas and
worldviews he encounters. Yet his project is tricky, as he still can’t
help but fall back on the transcendental language of culture,
politics, and science that he is familiar with to communicate what he
wants to say. There is also always the anthropological danger of
heroizing such traditions in a way that reduces their complexities. At
times, The New Science risks falling into the same trap as the debate
with Obeyesekere did, of the attempt to unearth what people really
think (or worse, believe), for one will never truly know. One might
ask not only why ideas of the metapersons are so lasting and
compelling but also why the anthropological impulse to take them “on
their own terms,” even if this is impossible, endures. It remains a
powerful mode of political self-critique—and a kind of self-help, much
needed—of which Sahlins is a master, although it ultimately speaks
more to “the West” than anyplace else, confronting it with other ways
to live and face death.
<p>

In between roving from the Amazon to New Guinea, Sahlins might have
opened the door of his study to the many contemporary American
metapersons, from extraterrestrials and angels to imaginary friends in
childhood. Even in any allegedly disenchanted culture, the vestiges of
the immanent never disappear. We continue to live in a world crowded
with nonhuman persons, from commercial brands who speak in distinct
“voices” on Twitter, to currencies with their own agency, to the meat
shunned by vegans, as Sahlins observes, on the premise of “the
personhood of food.”

<p>
Along with demons, ancestral spirits—including the “recent familial
dead”—are an especially populous global demographic. Sahlins writes
beautifully of traditions in which the dead are kept close at hand. In
Kwaio settlements in the Solomon Islands, he relates, people spoke as
frequently to their dead relatives as to their living ones. During a
festival period in the Trobriand Islands off New Guinea, when the
baloma, or ancestral souls, are said to return, the deceased are so
closely present that the living must be careful not to spill hot
drinks or wave sticks in the air, lest they injure the
spirits. “‘Lineage’ as the participation of the ancestor in the bodies
and identities of living persons—as by the transmission of ‘blood,’
‘bone,’ or ‘soul’—is a spiritual condition,” Sahlins writes. He might
also have explored the American ritual of transmitting samples by
mail—to corporations such as Ancestry.com and 23andMe—as a way to find
lost ancestors and locate ourselves in the still-enchanted webs of
human kinship. For “humans are spirits too,” Sahlins reminds us.
<p>

When the academic reviews of The New Science of the Enchanted Universe
began to appear, following its publication a year after Sahlins’s
death, I noticed a strange phenomenon: For a genre conventionally
prosaic, the scholarly critics kept having encounters with the
metaperson of Sahlins himself. When Katherine Pratt Ewing, a professor
of Islam at Columbia University, sat down to write her review at her
dining table on a Sunday morning, she suddenly found herself slipping
into “an almost hypnagogic state in which Marshall was a felt
presence,” she recalled in HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory. “It
wasn’t a matter of belief about whether this was possible—it just
was.” Ewing later realized that Sahlins had appeared to her on the
morning of his memorial service, held at the University of Chicago on
April 3, 2022.
<p>

“I kept trying to imagine how he would take my comments,” the
anthropologist Carlos Fausto wrote in another piece for HAU. “Would he
act like a benevolent or a mean-spirited ancestor?” Ancestors, Sahlins
had wryly observed, are ambivalent powers, usually the most moralistic
of all metahuman types. They are needy, even though “they are not
actually in need of anything,” to quote the Swiss ethnographer Henri
Junod. At the memorial service, Sahlins’s former doctoral student Sean
Dowdy gave a eulogy, and he was certain—for a moment—that he saw
Sahlins sitting in the crowd, carrying himself with a shabby
dignity. Dowdy spoke of how the late professor had been appearing to
him in dreams. In one, Dowdy walked up the stairs to Sahlins’s house
on University Avenue. Sahlins opened the door wearing his usual
navy-blue sweater vest, greeted Dowdy with a smile, and asked him how
the mourning had been going.

<p>
It seemed to me that Sahlins, ever since his death, was continuing to
develop the arguments of The New Science in a new way. (The book was
meant to be a trilogy, if only Sahlins had more time.) The scholar
Frederick B. Henry Jr., another former student and longtime friend,
worked tirelessly to prepare the manuscript for publication. Henry
told me how, as he was driving down a highway in Princeton to an early
morning appointment, he suddenly realized that Marshall was sitting in
the passenger seat. He stayed there for 10 minutes, as Henry’s hair
stood on end and a wave of joy and sadness overcame him. “I found
myself belly-laughing at some unidentifiable joke he had manifested
beside me to deliver,” Henry recalled. Sahlins was inimitably
demonstrating his point, of the immediacy of the spirit world that
ever surrounds us. “It is the flip-side, behind the mirror of our
limited being,” Henry wrote to me. “None of it need be considered
paranormal in the slightest. It is part and parcel of our human
condition…. I will eventually become a metaperson, to someone. So will
you.”

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpellation_(philosophy)" target="_blank">wikpedia</a>: &nbsp;
Interpellation is a concept introduced to Marxist theory by Louis
Althusser as the mechanism through which pre-existing social
structures "constitute" (or construct) individual human organisms as
subjects (with consciousness and agency).

<p>
Althusser asked how people
come voluntarily to live within class, gender, racial or other
identities, and argued that this happens through "state apparatuses"
(such as the family, mass media, schools, churches, the judicial
system, police, government) continually telling individuals what they
are from infancy.
<p>
In this way, apparatuses maintain the social
order. In Althusser's view, apparatuses call us (or ‘hail’ us, French
<i>interpeller</i>) by labels, and we learn to respond to those labels. In
this structuralist philosophy, social structures constitute subjects
rather than individuals constituting their own subjectivity for
themselves. 

**Origin of the term**<p>

The term interpellation is more common in French, the language in
which Althusser originally introduced the concept, than English. It
comes from the French verb interpeller, meaning "call out [to
someone]", "speak (abruptly) [to get someone's attention, to request
something, or to insult someone]". This French verb also has several
technical legal senses: to pose questions when interrogating a
suspected criminal; to notify someone that they are legally obliged to
do something; or a parliamentary summons to someone to account for
themself. Thus in both French and English the noun interpellation
denotes the act of interpellating someone.

**Precursors**<p>

The German philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer employed a
method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in
their text Dialectic of Enlightenment, although they did so 26 years
before "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" was
published. Rather than situating their analysis heavily on the State,
Adorno and Horkheimer argued that the mass media—the "culture
industry"—also plays a role in the construction of passive
subjects. So unlike the police officer in Althusser's example who
reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media now plays
a powerful complementary role in the creation of a passive
consumer. However, whereas Althusser sought to make subjectivity a
mere epiphenomenon of institutional interpellation, Adorno and
Horkheimer insisted on a concept of subjectivity that was not limited
to an institutional definition. They sought to expose tendencies
favoring "total administration" over the individual and their
subjective potential, while Althusser's analysis seemed only to
confirm those tendencies.

**Overview**<p>

In "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an
Investigation)", Althusser introduces the concepts of ideological
state apparatuses (ISAs) and repressive state apparatuses (RSAs),
institutions which make up society and which are instrumental to the
constant reproduction of the relations of production in that
society. While RSAs are institutions that directly repress dissent and
opposition (for example, the police and the military), ISAs (for
example family, church, schools, the media and politics) reproduce
capitalism through non-repressive ideological means. Consequently,
interpellation describes the process by which ideology, embodied in
major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes
the very nature of individual subjects' identities.
<p>
Althusser sees interpellation as an act of "hailing" individuals
through social interactions: "all ideology hails or interpellates
concrete individuals as concrete subjects"; "ideology 'acts' or
'functions' in such a way that it ... 'transforms' the individual into
subjects". For Althusser, interpellation ("hailing") is a
non-specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police
officer shouts (or hails) "Hey, you there!" and an individual turns
around and, so-to-speak, 'answers' the call, the individual becomes a
subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has
realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him
subjective to the ideology of democracy and law.
Another example is of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside
asks "Who is there?" and only opens the door once the "It's me" from
the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes
in "a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday
life". In other words, Althusser's central thesis is that "you and
I are always already subjects" and are constantly engaging in everyday
rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us
subject to ideology.
<p>
Althusser argued that "there is no ideology except by the subject and
for the subject". This notion of subjectivity became central to his
thought. According to Althusser, "ideology has always-already
interpellated individuals", that is, individuals are constituted as
subjects through being interpellated from before they are even
born. He further remarks about the individual identity under these
conditions:

<blockquote>the individual is interpellated as a (free) subject in order that he
shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject, i.e. in order
that he shall (freely) accept his subjection, i.e. in order that he
shall make the gestures and actions of his subjection 'all by
himself'.
</blockquote>

Consequently, individual subjects are presented principally as
produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent
agents with self-produced identities. Althusser's argument here
strongly draws from Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror
stage. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the "I" (i.e.,
the conscious ego which is created by the mirror stage) and the
"subject" (that is, the symbolic subject of the unconscious),
Althusser collapses both concepts into one.

**Other applications**<p>

Althusser's thought has made significant contributions to other French
philosophers, notably Derrida, Kristeva, Barthes, Foucault, Deleuze,
and Badiou. The feminist scholar and queer theorist Judith Butler
critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight
the social construction of gender identities. Butler argues that by
hailing "It's a boy/girl," the newborn baby is ultimately positioned
as subject.
<p>

Media theorist David Gauntlett argues that "interpellation occurs when
a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV
show, for example, this uncritical consumption means that the text has
interpellated us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to
tacitly accept a particular approach to the world."

**Louis Pierre Althusser**<p>

1918 – 1990,  a French
Marxist philosopher who studied at the École normale supérieure in
Paris, where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.

<p>

Althusser was a long-time member and sometimes a strong critic of the
French Communist Party (Parti communiste français, PCF). His arguments
and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the
theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence
of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist socialist
orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist
parties, as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of
ideology. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist,
although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is
not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of
structuralism. He later described himself as a social anarchist.

<p>
Althusser's life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In
1980, he killed his wife, the sociologist Hélène Rytmann, by
strangling her. He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity
and committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He did little
further academic work, dying in 1990.

_Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an

philosopher Louis Althusser. First published in 1970, it advances
Althusser's conception and critique of ideology.

<p>
Where Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels posited a thinly-sketched theory of ideology as a
system of falsehoods serving the ruling class,
Althusser draws upon the works of later theorists such as Antonio
Gramsci, Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to proffer a more elaborate
redefinition of the theory. Althusser's theory of ideology has
remained influential since it was written.

<b>Believing, with Max Weber ...</b>
<p>
In Chapter 1 of his 1973 essay collection, The Interpretation of Cultures,
Geertz states his aim:
<blockquote>
The concept of culture I espouse, and whose utility the
essays below attempt to demonstrate, is essentially a
semiotic one.
<p>
Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of
significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and
the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in
search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.
</blockquote>
<p>
He elaborates:
<blockquote>
It is
explication I am after, construing social expressions on their surface
enigmatical.
And it is not even, finally, meanings that I am after,
but rather significances.

<p>Culture is not a power, something to which
social events, behaviors, institutions, or processes can be causally
attributed; it is a context, something within which they can be
intelligibly— that is, thickly— described. In brief, a little thicker
description is what we need in this life, and that is what, I am here
to argue, ethnography, properly conceived as a thick description of
particular social situations, does indeed provide.

<p>The task of the
ethnographer is to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar,
to take, as it were, the native's point of view, to get inside his
head and see the world the way he does, to delineate the ethos of his
culture as that ethos is manifested in actual behavior.

**Religion as a Symbolic System**


Geertz defines religion as:

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<details>
   <summary>a system of symbols which acts to</summary>

<br>
Such a tremendous weight is being put on the term "symbol" here
that our first move must be to decide with some precision what we are
going to mean by it. This is no easy task, for, rather like "culture,"
"symbol" has been used to refer to a great variety of things, often a
number of them at the same time.
<p>
In some hands it is used for anything which signifies something else
to someone: dark clouds are the symbolic precursors of an on-coming
rain. In others it is used only for explicitly conventional signs of one
sort or another: a red flag is a symbol of danger, a white of surrender.
In others it is confined to something which expresses in an oblique and
figurative manner that which cannot be stated in a direct and literal one,
so that there are symbols in poetry but not in science, and symbolic
logic is misnamed. In yet others, however, it is used for any object, act,
event, quality, or relation which serves as a vehicle .for a conception—
the conception is the symbol's "meaning"—and that is the approach I
shall follow here.  (See 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Langer" target="_blank">Langer, Philosophy in a New Key</a>.)
<p>

The number 6, written, imagined, laid out as a row of stones, or even
punched into the program tapes of a computer, is a symbol. But so also
is the Cross, talked about, visualized, shaped worriedly in air or
fondly fingered at the neck, the expanse of painted canvas called
"Guernica" or the bit of painted stone called a churinga, the word
"reality," or even the morpheme "-ing." They are all symbols, or at
least symbolic elements, because they are tangible formulations of
notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms,
concrete embodiments of ideas, attitudes, judgments, longings, or
beliefs.  To undertake the study of cultural activity—activity in
which symbolism forms the positive content—is thus not to abandon
social analysis for a Platonic cave of shadows, to enter into a
mentalistic world of introspective psychology or, worse, speculative
philosophy, and wander there forever in a haze of "Cognitions,"
"Affections," "Conations," and other elusive entities. Cultural acts,
the construction, apprehension, and utilization of symbolic forms, are
social events like any other; they are as public as marriage and as
observable as agriculture.
<p>
They are not, however, exactly the same thing; or, more precisely,
the symbolic dimension of social events is, like the psychological, itself
theoretically abstractable from those events as empirical totalities.
There is still, to paraphrase a remark of Kenneth Burke's, a difference
between building a house and drawing up a plan for building a house,
and reading a poem about having children by marriage is not quite the
same thing as having children by marriage.
<p>

Even though the building of the house may proceed under the guidance
of the plan or—a less likely occurrence—the having of children may be
motivated by a reading of the poem, there is something to be said for
not confusing our traffic with symbols with our traffic with objects
or human beings, for these latter are not in themselves symbols,
however often they may function as such.
<p>

No matter how deeply interfused the cultural, the social, and the
psychological may be in the everyday life of houses, farms, poems, and
marriages, it is useful to distinguish them in analysis, and, so
doing, to isolate the generic traits of each against the normalized
background of the other two. So far as culture patterns, that is,
systems or complexes of symbols, are concerned, the generic trait
which is of first importance for us here is that they are extrinsic
sources of information. By "extrinsic," I mean only that—unlike genes,
for example—they lie outside the boundaries of the individual organism
as such in that intersubjective world of common understandings into
which all human individuals are born, in which they pursue their
separate careers, and which they leave persisting behind them after
they die.

<p>By "sources of information," I mean only that—like
genes—they provide a blueprint or template in terms of which processes
external to themselves can be given a definite form. As the order of
bases in a strand of DNA forms a coded program, a set of instructions,
or a recipe, for the synthesis of the structurally complex proteins
which shape organic functioning, so culture patterns provide such
programs for the institution of the social and psychological processes
which shape public behavior. Though the sort of information and the
mode of its transmission are vastly different in the two cases, this
comparison of gene and symbol is more than a strained analogy of the
familiar "social heredity" sort. It is actually a substantial
relationship, for it is precisely because of the fact that genetically
programmed processes are so highly generalized in men, as compared
with lower animals, that culturally programmed ones are so important; only because
human behavior is so loosely determined by intrinsic sources of information that extrinsic sources are so vital. To build a dam a beaver
needs only an appropriate site and the proper materials—his mode of
procedure is shaped by his physiology.

<p>But man, whose genes are silent on the building trades, needs also
a conception of what it is to build a dam, a conception he can get
only from some symbolic source—a blueprint, a textbook, or a string of
speech by someone who already knows how dams are built—or, of course,
from manipulating graphic or linguistic elements in such a way as to
attain for himself a conception of what dams are and how they are
built.  This point is sometimes put in the form of an argument that
cultural patterns are "models," that they are sets of symbols whose
relations to one another "model" relations among entities, processes
or what-haveyou in physical, organic, social, or psychological systems
by "paralleling," "imitating," or "simulating" them.8

<p> The term "model" has, however, two senses—an "of" sense and a
"for" sense—and though these are but aspects of the same basic concept
they are very much worth distinguishing for analytic purposes. In the
first, what is stressed is the manipulation of symbol structures so as
to bring them, more or less closely, into parallel with the
pre-established nonsymbolic system, as when we grasp how dams work by
developing a theory of hydraulics or constructing a flow chart. The
theory or chart models physical relationships in such a way—that is,
by expressing their structure in synoptic form—as to render them
apprehensible; it is a model of "reality." In the second, what is
stressed is the manipulation of the nonsymbolic systems in terms of
the relationships expressed in the symbolic, as when we construct a
dam according to the specifications implied in an hydraulic theory or
the conclusions drawn from a flow chart. Here, the theory is a model
under whose guidance physical relationships are organized: it is a
model for "reality." For psychological and social systems, and for
cultural models that we would not ordinarily refer to as "theories,"
but rather as "doctrines," "melodies," or "rites," the case is in no
way different. Unlike genes, and other nonsymbolic information
sources, which are only models for, not models of, culture patterns
have an intrinsic double aspect: they give meaning, that is, objective
conceptual form, to social and psychological reality both by shaping
themselves to it and by shaping it to themselves.

<p> ther sorts of significative forms. Models for are found, as the
gene example suggests, through the whole order of nature; for wherever
there is a communication of pattern, such programs are, in simple
logic, required. Among animals, imprint learning is perhaps the most
striking example, because what such learning involves is the automatic
presentation of an appropriate sequence of behavior by a model animal
in the presence of a learning animal which serves, equally
automatically, to call out and stabilize a certain set of responses
genetically built into the learning animal.9 The communicative dance
of two bees, one of which has found nectar and the other of which
seeks it, is another, somewhat different, more complexly coded,
example.10 Craik has even suggested that the thin trickle of water
which first finds its way down from a mountain spring to the sea and
smooths a little channel for the greater volume of water that follows
after it plays a sort of model for function.11 But models
of—linguistic, graphic, mechanical, natural, etc., processes which
function not to provide sources of information in terms of which other
processes can be patterned, but to represent those patterned processes
as such, to express their structure in an alternative medium—are much
rarer and may perhaps be confined, among living animals, to man. The
perception of the structural congruence between one set of processes,
activities, relations, entities, and so on, and another set for which
it acts as a program, so that the program can be taken as a
representation, or conception—a symbol—of the programmed, is the
essence of human thought. The intertransposability of models for and
models of which symbolic formulation makes possible is the distinctive
characteristic of our mentality.

<br>
So far as religious symbols and symbol systems are concerned this
intertransposability is clear. The endurance, courage, independence,
perseverance, and passionate willfulness in which the vision quest
practices the Plains Indian are the same flamboyant virtues by which
he attempts to live: while achieving a sense of revelation he
stabilizes a sense of direction. The consciousness of defaulted
obligation, secreted guilt, and, when a confession is obtained, public
shame in which Manus' seance rehearses him are the same sentiments
that underlie the sort of duty ethic by which his property-conscious
society is maintained: the gaining of an absolution involves the
forging of a conscience.13 And the same self-discipline which rewards
a Javanese mystic staring fixedly into the flame of a lamp with what
he takes to be an intimation of divinity drills him in that rigorous
control of emotional expression which is necessary to a man who would
follow a quietistic style of life.14 Whether one sees the conception
of a personal guardian spirit, a family tutelary, or an immanent God
as synoptic formulations of the character of reality or as templates
for producing reality with such a character seems largely arbitrary, a
matter of which aspect, the model of or model for, one wants for the
moment to bring into focus. The concrete symbols involved--one or
another mythological figure materializing in the wilderness, the skull
of the deceased household head hanging censoriously in the rafters, or
a disembodied "voice in the stillness" soundlessly chanting enigmatic
classical poetry--point in either direction. They both express the
world's climate and shape it.

<p> 

They shape it by inducing in the worshipper a certain distinctive set
of dispositions (tendencies, capacities, propensities, skills, habits,
liabilities, pronenesses) which lend a chronic character to the flow
of his activity and the quality of his experience. A disposition
describes not an activity or an occurrence but a probability of an
activity being performed or an occurrence occurring in certain
circumstances: "When a cow is said to be a ruminant, or a man is said
to be a cigarette-smoker, it is not being said that the cow is
ruminating now or that the man is smoking a cigarette now. To be a
ruminant is to tend to ruminate from time to time, and to be a
cigarette-smoker is to be in the habit of smoking cigarettes."15
Similarly, to be pious is not to be performing something we would call
an act of piety, but to be liable to perform such acts. So, too, with
the Plains Indian's bravura, the Manus' compunctiousness, or the
Javanese's quietism, which, in their contexts, form the substance of
piety. The virtue of this sort of view of what are usually called
"mental traits" or, if the Cartesianism is unavowed, "psychological
forces" (both unobjectionable enough terms in themselves) is that it
gets them out of any dim and inaccessible realm of private sensation
into that same well-lit world of observables in which reside the
brittleness of glass, the inflammability of paper, and, to return to
the metaphor, the dampness of England.
<p>

So far as religious activities are concerned (and learning a myth by
heart is as much a religious activity as detaching one's finger at the
knuckle), two somewhat different sorts of disposition are induced by
them: moods and motivations.

<p> 

A motivation is a persisting tendency, a chronic inclination to
perform certain sorts of acts and experience certain sorts of feeling
in certain sorts of situations, the "sorts" being commonly very
heterogenous and rather ill-defined classes in all three cases:
<p>

On hearing that a man is vain [i.e., motivated by vanity] we expect
him to behave in certain ways, namely to talk a lot about himself, to
cleave to the society of the eminent, to reject criticisms, to seek
the footlights and to disengage himself from conversations about the
merits of others. We expect him to indulge in roseate daydreams about
his own successes, to avoid recalling past failures and to plan for
his own advancement. To be vain is to tend to act in these and
innumerable other kindred ways. Certainly we also expect the vain man
to feel certain pangs and flutters in certain situations; we expect
him to have an acute sinking feeling when an eminent person forgets
his name, and to feel buoyant of heart and light of toe on hearing of
the misfortunes of his rivals. But feelings of pique and buoyancy are
not more directly indicative of vanity than are public acts of
boasting or private acts of daydreaming.16
<p>

Similarly for any motivations. As a motive, "flamboyant courage"
consists in such enduring propensities as to fast in the wilderness,
to conduct solitary raids on enemy camps, and to thrill to the thought
of counting coup. "Moral circumspection" consists in such ingrained
tendencies as to honor onerous promises, to confess secret sins in the
face of severe public disapproval, and to feel guilty when vague and
generalized accusations are made at seances. And "dispassionate
tranquility" consists in such persistent inclinations as to maintain
one's poise come hell or high water, to experience distaste in the
presence of even moderate emotional displays, and to indulge in
contentless contemplations of featureless objects. Motives are thus
neither acts (that is, intentional behaviors) nor feelings, but
liabilities to perform particular classes of act or have particular
classes of feeling. And when we say that a man is religious, that is,
motivated by religion, this is at least part--though only part--of
what we mean.

<p> 

Another part of what we mean is that he has, when properly stimulated,
a susceptibility to fall into certain moods, moods we sometimes lump
together under such covering terms as "reverential," "solemn," or
"worshipful." Such generalized rubrics actually conceal, however, the
enormous empirical variousness of the dispositions involved, and, in
fact, tend to assimilate them to the unusually grave tone of most of
our own religious life. The moods that sacred symbols induce, at
different times and in different places, range from exultation to
melancholy, from self-confidence to self-pity, from an incorrigible
playfulness to a bland listlessness--to say nothing of the erogenous
power of so many of the world's myths and rituals. No more than there
is a single sort of motivation one can call piety is there a single
sort of mood one can call worshipful.

 
<p>

The major difference between moods and motivations is that where the
latter are, so to speak, vectorial qualities, the former are merely
scalar. Motives have a directional cast, they describe a certain
overall course, gravitate toward certain, usually temporary,
consummations. But moods vary only as to intensity: they go
nowhere. They spring from certain circumstances but they are
responsive to no ends. Like fogs, they just settle and lift; like
scents, suffuse and evaporate. When present they are totalistic: if
one is sad everything and everybody seems dreary; if one is gay,
everything and everybody seems splendid. Thus, though a man can be
vain, brave, willful, and independent at the same time, he can't very
well be playful and listless, or exultant and melancholy, at the same
time.17 Further, where motives persist for more or less extended
periods of time, moods merely recur with greater or lesser frequency,
coming and going for what are often quite unfathomable reasons. But
perhaps the most important difference, so far as we are concerned,
between moods and motivations is that motivations are "made
meaningful" with reference to the ends toward which they are conceived
to conduce, whereas moods are "made meaningful" with reference to the
conditions from which they are conceived to spring. We interpret
motives in terms of their consummations, but we interpret moods in
terms of their sources. We say that a person is industrious because he
wishes to succeed; we say that a person is worried because he is
conscious of the hanging threat of nuclear holocaust. And this is no
less the case when the interpretations are ultimate. Charity becomes
Christian charity when it is enclosed in a conception of God's
purposes; optimism is Christian optimism when it is grounded in a
particular conception of God's nature. The assiduity of the Navaho
finds its rationale in a belief that, since "reality" operates
mechanically, it is coercible; their chronic fearfulness finds its
rationale in a conviction that, however "reality" operates, it is both
enormously powerful and terribly dangerous.

   <summary>Tulalip Tribe's summary</summary>

From the Tulalip Tribe's <a href="https://tulaliplushootseed.com/story-tellers/harry-moses/" target="_blank">website</a>:

Harry Moses was born on November 15, 1878 up the Skagit river Valley
in the town of Marblemount. Harry and his wife Jessie had eight
children, William Moses, Zatha Moses, Regina Moses Dallaire, Persina H
Moses, Mahcina L Moses, Rydnillo W Moses, Anna B Moses and Arnold C
Moses.
<p>
Harry’s father was Will-Ab-To-Chub Charley Moses, who was born in  1853.
 His mother was Sha-Sha-Bow-Lits-Ah or Mary, she was born in  1852. Jesse’s father was Bon-Quah-am.

<p>
The Moses family were heavily involved with their relatives and fellow
members of the Shaker church. They lived mainly in the Upper Skagit
area, around Marblemount. They spent a good deal of time with the
Anderson family. Vi Hilbert in Haboo wrote that her, and her parents,
visited quite often because her parents thoroughly enjoyed each
other’s company. She wrote, “I loved to listen in.

Harry had a wonderful sense of humor, which was well known. He loved
to tell stories and his audience knew that they could count on him to
embellish the facts, with a twinkle in his eyes. Why, Harry saw the
eyes of the woman in the moon, and the fish he caught in the Cascade
river behind his house were so big that when he lifted them onto his
shoulder, the tails would drag far behind him on the ground.

Harry died on October 24, 1955 in Sedro-Woolley.

  <summary>An indirect account of Harry Moses's social setting</summary>

(from the introduction to Sally Snyder's dissertation, 
Skagit society and its existential basis: an ethnofolkloristic reconstruction. University of Washington, 1964)

Non-reservation Indians who lived in and near towns were descended
from people who inhabited areas less accessible and attractive to
Whites. Those Skagits had resisted in battle removal to
reservations. Except for that unfortunate meeting with Whites who were
of the military, and a few surveyors and miners passing through now
and then, significant contacts with Caucasians were not until after
1875 with the first pioneer settlers in their area.

During the years I knew non-reservation Skagits they were also
surrounded by White neighbors and were even more of a minority
population where they lived than Reservation Indians. But they were
economically independent, with standards of living which did not
distinguish them from Caucasian neighbors. They seemed to have been
socially and psychologically more stable than reservation
people. Despite the physical isolation of upriver families from other
Indians - so different from the community setting of reservations -
 there was more unity among them. Cultural decay had progressed no
further, if as far, than for reservation Skagits. But it had been
supplanted by Western elements which had led not to the
disorganization, disturbances, and hopelessness I saw on the
Reservation, but to a degree of positive identification as being both
Indians and members of a predominantly White community.

In the years I knew and worked with Skagits on the Reservation and
elsewhere, only memories about native culture had been preserved
intact, and these were limited to the elderly and a few of the
middle-aged. No one under forty spoke or understood more than a few
words of an Indian language. My researches were on last survivors of
an aboriginal culture.
