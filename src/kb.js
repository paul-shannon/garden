Read by Alan Davis Drake</a>


Whitman celebrates human bodies in his poem from 1855:  specific flesh, and
body parts, male and female.  We find some sexism and, at what at the time was
surely scandalous homoerotic sexuality.

<p>Whitman starts safely, extolling manly upright
farmers, laborers, and young men wrestling.  He moves to women - all, as with the
males, implicitly white.  He then turns, in sections 7 and 8 of this 9
stanza poem, to

<blockquote>
   A man's body at auction...
   A woman's body at auction...
</blockquote>

and his purpose becomes clear.  Humans all, intricate and beautiful, strong and worthy:
this is an anti-slavery poem, arguing for the equal beauty and worth of all human bodies.

<blockquote>
Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve...
</blockquote>

Whitman's vision is uncommon today.  Novel machines and the artificial
excite more admiration than the mundane, the organic.  Whitman saw
and proclaimed wonder and beauty in the world, with an enthusiasm
which though, today, sometimes seems over-ripe, might - if refracted through new
understandings of the world - serve me well.

I follow Whitman but I wish to go further.  We have learned much about
the elegance and interconnectedness of life in the last century.  The
dividing line between human and other has dissolved.  We have huge
brains which make complex grammars possible, and metaphor and music.
Other species have their own capabilities just as worthy of
admiration.

But rather than compare and rank (or compare and <b>not</b> rank), my focus, building on
Whitman, is on seeing the interwoven elegant processes shared by all of us, indeed
coursing through all of us, energy captured non-destructively from the sun, exciting
electrons which flow in all life forms, from sunlit leaf to scampering squirrel, deep diving
whales, laughing children, symbiotic relations, even also contagious disease.

The body electric: now to see it as the entire evolving interconnected communities of the planet.

When first published, the poem had no title.  When republished in 1867 with some revisions,
the first line was added, and became the title.   Jerome Loving's 1999
<a href="" target="_blank">biography</a> (need more detail here)
explains that the term "electric" was not then in common use.

From Carol Rumen's "Poem of the Week" in the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/27/poem-of-the-week-from-i-sing-the-body-electric-by-walt-whitman" target="_blank">Guardian</a>:

<blockquote>

It was one of 12 poems Whitman printed and published himself as Leaves of Grass (1855), the first collection of a writer who, in his mid-30s, had suddenly found his unique form and themes.
<p>
The poem was untitled, and began somewhat less ringingly, with a version of what was subsequently to become the second line. Revised, and with the addition of Part 9, the section that forms this week’s poem, it appeared as Poem of the Body in the 1856 edition of Leaves of Grass, and was ultimately incorporated into the sequence Children of Adam (1867).
<p>
The length and bagginess of Whitman’s inventory have provoked some criticisms. It doesn’t strictly follow the organisational principles that first seem to operate – head to toes, exterior to interior. There’s some mixing of categories as the poem gathers speed near the end. But the rollercoaster is still an exciting, if a bumpy, ride. The specificity of the diction is a clear virtue: where it’s less than specific, the euphemism or obscure coinage (man-root, neck-slue) forms a collectible linguistic curio. The way in which medically untrained people talk about their bodies is always fascinating. For most of us, the vocabulary is an odd, rather embarrassed assortment of the informal and the official, and so it is with Whitman. His vocabulary includes the plainest, everyday denotations – head, eyes, mouth and nose – with a few Latinate sprinklings: tympan and scapula. Some compound words are invented but vividly understandable: eye-fringes, hind-shoulders and lung-sponges. Sometimes, there’s an added descriptive detail, like “The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame”, that he seems to write from the experience of viewing preserved human remains.
<p>
As the list accumulates, abstract nouns appear – sympathies, sexuality, maternity. Whitman deliberately makes his case for the inclusion of women in the democratic body, and emotions enter the mix of feminine attributes (“tears, laughter, weeping, love-look …”). The figure is not always gendered: sometimes it could be either male or female, and, perhaps, either black or white: “The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair.” A particular relationship just might be evoked in “The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body”. There are a few other moments when a detail will suggest that the universal love-poem embraces a personal love-affair, but there are no details that can’t be read as modes of the universal.
<p>
As the section unfolds, the body seems increasingly active, whether “reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening” or displaying in close-up “The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes.” It’s plain that the speaker has closely observed actual bodies in motion. For all the excited, headlong oratory, Whitman is at least as much a scientist as a romantic poet. The very phrase “body electric” includes both dimensions.
<p>
The body he animates is electrified above all by the way in which the parts interact, whether the interaction is explicit or implied, and by the way in which bodies interact, in mutual respect or its opposite, exploitation. As he tells us, bodies (“the likes of you and me”) are poems. This particular praise-song is to the young, healthy body, idealised, perhaps, but not in any sense deified. How astonishing it seems now that lines so frank in vocabulary (and metrically so free) could have been written in 1855. But then, this was the New World, and Whitman’s first symphony.

Some etymological background:

   - electric eels were known in pharaonic egypt

   - Several ancient writers, such as Pliny the Elder and Scribonius
     Largus, attested to the numbing effect of electric shocks
     delivered by electric catfish and electric rays, and knew that
     such shocks could travel along conducting objects.  Patients with
     ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric
     fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them.[4]

   - Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual
     curiosity for millennia until 1600, when the English scientist
     William Gilbert wrote De Magnete, in which he made a careful
     study of electricity and magnetism, distinguishing the lodestone
     effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber. He
     coined the Neo-Latin word electricus ("of amber" or "like amber",
     from ἤλεκτρον, elektron, the Greek word for "amber") to refer to
     the property of attracting small objects after being rubbed. This
     association gave rise to the English words "electric" and
     "electricity", which made their first appearance in print in
     Thomas Browne's Pseudodoxia Epidemica of 1646.

   - Michael Faraday inventied the electric motor in 1821.

   - Thomas Edison's patent for the electric light bulb was issued in 1880.

`
**Reflective Equilibrium**

From <u>Considered Judgement</u> by Catherine Elgin, 1995, Preface,
page ix.

Philosophy long sought to set knowledge on a firm foundation, through
derivation of indubitable truths by infallible rules.  For want of
such truths and rules, the enterprise foundered.  Certainty is not to
be had.

Nevertheless, foundationalism's heirs continue thier forebears' quest,
seeking security against epistemic misfortune.  Their detractors
typically espouse unbridled coherentism or a facile cultural relativism.

Neither stance is tenable.  To devise a via media between the absolute
and the arbitrary requires reconceiving the nature, goals, and methods
of epistemology.

[This book] develops and argues for a reconception that takes
reflective equilibrium as the standard of rational acceptability.
A system of thought is in reflective equilibrium when its components
are reasonable in light of one another, and the account they comprise is
reasonable in light of our antecedent convictions about the
subject at hand.  Such a system affords no guarantees.  It is rationally
acceptable, I contend, not because it is certainly true but because
it is reasonable in the epistemic circumstances.

Since such a position forsakes the goals of certainty and permanent
credibility, I begin by arguing that those goals cannot, in any
case, be met. I then develop the positive account, showing that it has
valuable resources that more familiar approaches lack.

Many epistemologists now concede that certainty is a chimerical goal.
But they continue to accept the traditional conception of
epistemology's problematic.  For them, the quest remains how to
justify literal, factual beliefs.

I suggest that in abandoning the quest for certainty we gain
opportunities for a broader epistemological purview -- one that
comprehends the arts and does justice to the sciences.

The position I advocate thus recognizes that metaphor, fiction,
emotion and exemplification often advance understanding in
science as well as in art.

The range of epistemology turns out to be broader and
more variegated than is usually recognized.  Tenable systems of
thought are neither absolute nor arbitrary.  But even though
they are subject to revision, they are good in ways of belief.

"simondonOverview":
`
**Gilbert Simondon (1924-1989)**

From <u>The Incorporeal: Ontology, Ethics and the Limits of Materialism</u>,
Elizabeth Grosz, 2017, Chapter 5, Simondon and the Preindividual.

Simondon aims to replace the study of ontology, of what is, with the
study of ontogenesis, the various processes of self-formation that create
what is. Simondon devoted his earliest writings to the pre-Socratics, for
whom nature was the unquestioned source of existence and creativity.3
He was thoroughly steeped in ancient philosophy, from the writings of
Plato, Aristotle, the Epicureans, and the Stoics, in many cases returning to pre-Platonic conceptions of the coexistence of life and nature, to
the kind of philosophy that existed before science, poetry, the arts, and
philosophy became separated. The separation and privileging of form
over matter—hylomorphism—which began with Socrates and is accomplished by Aristotle, becomes a significant conceptual obstacle to a thoroughgoing understanding of the continuities and discontinuities, the
rising and falling of order and information, that connects the human,
and other forms of life, to the orders of the universe. p 170.

**The Preindividual**

Insofar as an individual exists, there must be a process, or many,
that produces it. This is Simondon’s most basic axiom—to seek out the
phases by which, from initial conditions, a being comes into
existence, not through an identity, a preformed path, or the
imposition of a preexisting form or plan on unformed matter. Such
conceptions are hylomorphic: they consider matter to be passive and
unformed—indeed, they are considered fundamentally feminine since at
least the time of Aristotle, if not before, and form to be a
masculine, active, imposing, ordering process. I have suggested
elsewhere that the dichotomization of thought through presence and
absence into dualistic and mutually exclusive terms—mind and body,
reason and passion, self and other—may have its origins in the
transformation of sexual difference into sexual opposition (the most
elementary gesture of patriarchy). [see Elizabeth Grosz, <i>The
Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution, and the Untimely</i> 2004.


It is the transformation of difference that Simondon addresses. Not
only is the hylomorphic schema unable to explain the coming into
existence of individuals, its terms, form and matter, require that
their own geneses as individuals be addressed. His challenge to
hylomorphism is an analysis of the coming into existence of
hylomorphism itself, the ontogenesis of philosophical models that,
because of their binarized structure, have lost direct contact with
the preindividual forces that are used to produce and sustain the
various orders of individuations.

source: Five Years Behind Hitler's Barbed Wire: A Diary of French Officers in a German Prison Camp, 1940-1945,
Henri Natter and Adam Refregier.

One of the more notable and searing events of World War II was the
unexpected and sudden fall of France in 1940, a major liberal
democracy with a glorious military past, the débâcle as it quickly
became known. Swiftly and efficiently overrun by the Wehrmacht in late
spring 1940 in only a matter of weeks, France suffered a crushing blow
to its morale and national pride that just several decades before had
been uplifted by difficult and costly victories at Verdun and the
first and second battles of the Marne.
<p>

This is the story of French officers, prisoners of war in an Oflag in
the Third Reich. Many books and stories have been written about the
numerous German prison camps during World War II, but very little has
been told about Oflags, camps specifically for Allied officers, who by
international convention were not required to work. Non-commissioned
officers and enlisted men were sent to stalags, from where they
generally went to work for the Germans.
<p>
Yet, when the
dust settled at the end of the battle for France in 1940, of the two
million men prisoners of war (mostly French: 1,800,000) 36,000 were
officers. The majority remained prisoners for as much as five years.

Five thousand French officers were sent to Oflag XVIIA, located in a
mountainous area northwest of Vienna, Austria. These men who had held
leading positions, either in the military or as civilians, were thrown
together at random in deplorable living conditions with nothing to do,
leaving them idle all day except for meals and roll calls. The curse
of idle time became an oppor-tunity. Setting up their own
administrative structure, and over the years utilizing their
wide-ranging knowledge and know-how, they created a small town with
its own university, library, newspaper, theater, and orchestra.

<p>

Ruyer spent almost the entire war in a pris-oner-of-war camp on the
grounds of former Wehrmacht training barracks in northeastern
Austria. The prisoners of Oflag XVIl-A, as it was called, enjoyed a
relatively high degree of freedom, and were encouraged to keep busy
during the long months of captivity.  Among the officers at the camp
were a good number of academics, and so these men organized lectures
on mathematics, philosophy, and biology, among other subjects. They
called themselves the Université en captivité. Wolff, early in an
eminent career as a teratologist (an embryologist focused on
abnormalities), held a private, high-level biology seminar that Ruyer
attended for more than a year.  In his memoirs, Wolff recalled that
Ruyer stood out in the group not only because, as a professional
philosopher, he was a relative outsider to biology, but also because
of his distinctive, at times "paradoxical" approach to biological
problems. As Wolff remem-bered, "[Ruyer] had a precise, if a bit
literary, knowledge of biological problems like any scholar trained in
the classics without himself having experimented on living matter."


<p>

Ruyer's study of embryology at the Universit en captivité
fundamentally transformed his philosophical project. His pre-war
philosophy had articulated a universal, mechanist ontology of
structure. In the postwar period he moved toward a materialist
finalism. His study of embryology under the guidance of Wolff helped
him transform his mechanist ontology into the neo-finalist materialism
for which he is known. It also helped him resolve a specific problem,
that of temporality, which he had been unable to account for in his
earliest work.

**Felicitous Falsehoods**<br>

This is philosopher Catherine Elgin's felicitous phrase, introduced in her 2017
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Enough-Press-Catherine-Elgin/dp/0262036533/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GSR2ATI0U171&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aL_vZYUZWgm5mBgiqZ3ycmxP92FGZLHCV5rJkDoi5bJdZCnNAXJbd6muiMt3vT-9mecyYcnI09UkqT1bf-7pcpoeFTsxt8Ce5f9L8NsA57Tf8FOtg1PYP8VWt9oiFBFnaixb8n3iee13OeoKNXteFQ0L1C3HrO09UtvSn02aSoatnZbIN52x5zhGQar6j7ZLEABDbz5P3-qQJN6q5O64jsNIOm7hmDFRBulRJYQAWXQ.cUCW37_AwICiPyZxcInJ7nUmbw6lx50TqawSsjf9ozI&dib_tag=se&keywords=catherine+elgin&qid=1725045264&s=books&sprefix=catherine+elgin%2Cstripbooks%2C162&sr=1-1" target="_blank">True Enough</a>.   

She shows, as I will
selectively reproduce here, felicitous falsehoods - models, theories, thought experiments, metaphors -
are crucial to finding our way in the world.

<blockquote>

Philosophy valorizes truth. There may be practical or prudential or
political reasons to accept a known falsehood. But there can, it is
held, never be epistemically good reasons to do so. Nor can there be
good reasons to accept modes of justification that are known not to be
truth conducive. Such is the prevailing consensus.

<p> Although it seems
reasonable, this stance has a fatal flaw. It cannot account for the
epistemic standing of science: for science unabashedly relies on
models, idealizations, and thought experiments that are known not to
be true.

<p>Modern science is one of humanity's greatest cognitive
achievements. To think that this achievement is a fluke would be
mad. So epistemology has the task of accounting for science's
success. A truth-centered, or veritistic, epistemology must treat
models, idealizations, and thought experiments as mere heuristics, or
forecast their disappearance with the advancement of scientific
understanding. Neither approach is plausible.

<p>We should not cavalierly
assume that the inaccuracy of models and idealizations constitutes an
inadequacy; quite the opposite. I suggest that their divergence from
truth or representational accuracy fosters their epistemic
functioning. When effective, models and idealizations are, I contend,
felicitous falsehoods. They are more than heuristics. They are
ineliminable and epistemically valuable components of the
understanding science supplies.

**Backstories**<br>

Backstories abound.  We have Marx and Darwin, we have Christian,
Jewish and Islamic cosmic narratives from Genesis to the Battle of
Armageddon.  We have the American founding and exceptionalism, the
recent neoliberal prediction of "an end to history", the AI
Singularity and human/machine hybrids populating the galaxy.  Or
nuclear holocaust, the heat death of the universe, a looming sixth
great extinction.  These narratives are all part of the cultural mix
in which I live.

<p>Indigenous narratives
from across the globe are often of a different sort, strong on origin
stories, less obvioulsy focused on cosmic goals and endpoints to achieve.

<p> Not so clearly stated, but nearly universal in the west, interlaced
with western narratives, is what we might call the "Triumphant Human Career", our species
sui generis, risen from obscure origins to dominate the planet, eventually also the
solar system and the galaxy: <i>that</i> is the narrative, the story, the meaning of life.

<blockquote> todo: incorporate, but don't get overwhelmed by and stuck in,
Kermode's "The Sense of an Ending", Eliade's "The Myth of the Eternal Return"
Descola's four ontologies in Beyond Nature and Culture.
</blockquote>

<p> I will not - indeed, I am unable to - argue for or against the
truth of any of these.  Each tells a story.  Each has a
beginning. Many propose, a goal, a direction.

<p> I would rather ask the
anthropologist's question: not "which of these  is True?" but rather "what does
each imply, how did they arise, and what forms of life and further stories come from them?"

<p>
And I also ask:  what narratives shape my own view of the world?  Some of them explicit, known to me,
but some imperfectly, incompletely or entirely unknown as I go about my business.
And what freedom, and by what means achieved, may I reorder, rearrange, maybe replace some of them?

<p> Philosopher Catherine Elgin and anthropologist Clifford Geertz are among those who
guide me in my efforts to ask and answer these questions.

<p> I keep and tend this digital garden to explore these questions.

<p>

The approach I develop here focuses on a cognitive process called
conceptual metaphor, which is a common denominator of material culture
and language. Previous studies have shown that the conceptual
metaphors of ancestral speech communities are embedded in the
documented languages of their descendants.  Recent archaeological
research shows that these metaphors are also expressed in
archaeological material culture.

<p> Based on these findings I suggest it
is possible to relate archaeological complexes to protolanguages by
correlating conceptual systems as they are expressed in the
archaeological record and in potentially related languages.

<p> I will
first review current methods for relating archaeology and language and
discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then I will introduce
conceptual metaphor as an additional basis for linking archaeology and
language, show how one can reconstruct protometaphors from linguistic
and archaeological evidence, and apply these methods in a case study
that traces the migration of a specific speech community from its
homeland in the Mesa Verde region of the U.S. Southwest.

<blockquote>We are stardust. We are golden. We are billion year old carbon.</blockquote>

<p>This comes from the 1969 Joni Mitchell song, <i>Woodstock</i>. The
song may be a dated, hippie, period piece, but there is some good
science in the chorus. Stars shine because of the nuclear fusion of
hydrogen to form helium in the star's interior. After billions of
years, most of a star's hydrogen is used up so the star's core
collapses and gets even hotter.

<p>Depending on the star's mass, the collapsing core may cause
additional fusion reactions which produce heavier elements such as
iron. Some of these stars explode in a massive supernova which flings
all these elements into space, where they collide with interstellar
dust and gas. This is where chemical compounds like carbon and water,
the stuff that we are made of, are formed in the universe. We are, in
fact, stardust.

**WindsFromTheNorth: Tewa Origins and Historical Anthropology**<br>

Anthropologist Scott Ortman, combining cultural anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics
in his study of the Mesa Verde -> Tewa transition, argues in four parts for, not just correlation,
but some (reciprocal?) causation as well.
<ul>
   <li> Culture as shared mental models
   <li> How to read ancient minds
   <li> Metaphor and major transitions
   <li> An hypothesis on culture and complexity
</ul>

He hypothesizes correlations between metaphoric transformations and qualitative
changes in the scale, integration and differentiation, complexity of human society.
How might these metaphors actually encouraged those kinds of changes?
<p>
The migration from Mesa Verde (and Chaco Canyon?) to the upper Rio Grande Valley,
and the origin of the Teva culture, about 1250 BC, is accompanied, this
archaeolgist argues, in a shift from bowl metaphors, to upright corn/people/rain
rectilinear images.
<p>


Documents the shift, in language and material history, from a bowl
metaphor to rectilinear.   See minute 28 in the video below.  Bowl
images in historical linguistics, while upright corn/person images
are present in contempory Tewa songs.

<p>

The Tewa-speaking pueblos near Santa Fe have always claimed ancestry
from the ancient peoples the Apache called "Anasazi" - those ancient
ones who vanished rather abruptly from Mesa Verde and Chaco Canyon
around 800 years ago. It's taken careful work by Dr. Scott Ortman to
sort through the web of conflicting anthropological theories,
disjunctive material artifacts and complex linguistic, cultural and
genetic clues to find a scientific validation for what the indigenous
Tewa people have been telling us all along about their ethnogenesis,
i.e. where they came from.  In his lecture at the Telluride Historical
Museum this spring, Ortman laid out his case quite elegantly. And his
prize-winning new book (derived from his Ph. D. thesis) assembles all
the intricate details -- Winds from the North: Tewa Origins and
Historical Anthropology (Univ. of Utah Press, Salt Lake City, 2012)
For years anthropologists were mystified because, although there was a
sudden population increase in the Rio Grande region right around the
time Mesa Verde and Chaco were depopulated, none of the cultural
artifacts from Mesa Verde culture (pottery styles, architectural
styles, etc.) ever appeared in the Rio Grande region.

<p>
The “abandonment” of Mesa Verde and the formation of the Rio Grande
Pueblos represent two classic events in North American
prehistory. Yet, despite a century of research, no consensus has been
reached on precisely how, or even if, these two events were
related. In this landmark study, Scott Ortman proposes a novel and
compelling solution to this problem through an investigation of the
genetic, linguistic, and cultural heritage of the Tewa Pueblo people
of New Mexico.

<p>
Integrating data and methods from human biology, linguistics,
archaeology, and cultural anthropology, Ortman shows that a striking
social transformation took place as Mesa Verde people moved to the Rio
Grande, such that the resulting ancestral Tewa culture was a unique
hybrid of ideas and practices from various sources. While addressing
several long-standing questions in American archaeology, Winds from
the North also serves as a methodological guidebook, including new
approaches to integrating archaeology and language based on cognitive
science research. As such, it will be of interest to researchers
throughout the social and human sciences.

**Nucleosynthesis**<p>

From <a href="https://www.earthdate.org/files/000/003/619/EarthDate_353_C.pdf" target="_blank">ErthDate.org</a>

<p>

Nearly everything in the universe was made by stars.
Stars are fueled by nuclear fusion. They fuse atoms of the
lightest element, with only one proton—hydrogen—into the
next lightest element, with two protons—helium.
In every fusion reaction, they’re creating an atom of a new
element.
<p>

When they’ve used up their hydrogen, they begin to
fuse the remaining helium into a heavier element, carbon.
<p>

Then they’ll fuse that into oxygen and progressively
heavier elements.
<p>

Each of these fusion reactions is less energetic, so by the
time the star is fusing iron, it’s nearing the end of its life.
<p>

The star may soon explode in a supernova, dispersing the
elements it created into other solar systems where they
may be used to form planets.
<p>

After a supernova, the star may continue to exist as a
black hole or an extremely dense neutron star. In this
environment, elements like iron can capture free neutrons
to form still heavier elements like silver, gold or plutonium.
The atoms that came together to form Earth 4.5 billion years
ago were once part of stars that lived and died long before.
<p>

Almost every atom in your body is billions of years old,
from the calcium in your bones to the carbon in your DNA,
recycled countless times.
<p>

That song was right: we are stardust. Stars made the
elements that make us.

<p>
Any attempt to speak without speaking any particular language is not
more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no

<p>Thus every living and healthy religion has a
marked idiosyncrasy. Its power consists in its special and surprising
message and in the bias which that revelation gives to life. The
vistas it opens and the mysteries it propounds are another world to

"mudra":

<b>Dogen on the Cosmic Mudra</b>

“When one displays the buddha mudra with one’s whole body and mind…”
<p>

This “one” is a translation of hito – it means a person. He didn’t say
“if a buddha sits in zazen” or “if an enlightened person sits in
zazen,” but any person, and even for a short time. Even if we sit as a
very beginner for the first time, the same thing happens in our
zazen. Buddha mudra is a translation of butsu in. Earlier, Dōgen used
the expression ichi butsu shin in; this is the same thing. This in is
mudra, ichi is of course one, so this means, “one buddha mind mudra.”

<p>

You may know the word “mudra.” [shows mudra with hands]. When we sit
in zazen we hold our hands like this and we make an oval with the
thumbs. This is called hokkai gyo in; in English, “cosmic mudra.” This
means that two sides or duality becomes one, one form, or one
circle. In Buddhism, there are many different mudras or ways to hold
the hands depending upon which buddha is being described or
depicted. Each mudra has its own meaning. But here, this kanji for
mudra means in English a stamp or seal. A seal is when you write a
letter, put it in an envelope and seal it with something, or put a
stamp on it to show by whom this letter is written. Stamps or seals
are very important in Chinese and Japanese culture. On certain
paintings or calligraphy, if someone’s seal is there, it is a
certification that this painting or calligraphy was done by this
person. Even today in Japanese society we have a stamp or a seal, and
we use it to make legal interactions. This stamp is like a signature
in American society.

__Mythology of Puget Sound__<br>
by Herman Haeberlin
<p>

The following collection of tales from Puget Sound was made by Dr.
 Herman Haeberlin on an expedition which was made possible by the
 generosity of Mr. Homer E. Sargent of Pasadena, California. Unfortu-
 nately Dr. Haeberlin died before he had time to work out his material,
 and the tales have been written out from his notebooks by Erna Gunther
 Spier.
<p>

 The first group (pp. 372-391) are transformer tales which belong
 to the group characteristic of Vancouver Island and Puget Sound. The
 name Hdldk" by which the transformer is called by the Skagit may be
 related to the name Xals or Xils by which he is known on southern
 Vancouver Island. In a number of cases tales belonging to different
 cycles, or isolated tales, have been incorporated into this cycle. Thus the
 first tale of our series describing the origin of the transformer is not known
 in this form from the Gulf of Georgia (see F. Boas : Mythology of the
 Tsimshian, RBAE 31, pp. 586 et seq.). The Star-Husband story has also
 been made part of this cycle.

 Mink and Raven who are important figures in the origin myths of
 the northern coast tribes, appear here also in a number of tales. The
 modern version of the origin of daylight (which is identified with the
 clock), is rather peculiar.

 The tribes of the east coast of Puget Sound represented here have
 been deeply influenced by those of the interior, as is manifested by the

__How the Sons of Mink and Raven Stole Light__

<p>
(Skagit : told by Charlie's wife)
<p>

In the beginning of the world the people lived in a village.
one son and Mink had one son. They said, "Let us train our children."
Where Mink and Raven lived it was dark, but in the east there was
light. They agreed to train their sons to be strong young men.

<p> Young Mink and young Raven practised running and became good
runners.  They came home and told their fathers that they were good
runners so their fathers told them to steal light from the people in
the East.

<p>In the East there is a light country. When they came to a
house in this country Mink went inside, but Raven stayed without. Mink
disguised himself as an old man before he entered the house. The
people let him come in and lie down for he acted as if he could not
walk. When night came he tried to steal the light. He got up and
touched the light. It flickered. The people woke up and asked where
Mink was. 
<p>

But Mink quickly got under the covers and the people did not find out anything.
The next night Mink tried the same thing again. The light flickered
again and the people woke up and looked to see whether Mink was in
bed. Again Mink got under the covers. Mink did this the third night and
the same thing happened. The fourth night he made up his mind to
get the light this time.

<p>
Raven had been waiting outside at some distance.

<p>Mink now acted like
a young man again and caught the light quickly and ran away with it.The
people woke up and saw that Mink was gone. They followed him. Mink
ran until he was almost tired out. Then he shouted to Raven to take the
light. Raven took it and ran on.

<p> The people followed Mink and Raven
until they reached the dark country. The people of the dark country
saw the light coming and their country became light. Old Raven and old
Mink were proud of their sons for having stolen the light from the country
in the east. Old Raven wanted to have the light all the time, but the
other people wanted it to go down from time to time. The wish of the
latter prevailed.

"minkAndTheClock":
`
__How Mink Got Daylight (Skagit)__:
<p>
In olden times it was dark all the time and the only light was the
moon. But there was daylight in the east. Mink and his younger brother
Sole and his cousin Raven talked about the man who had daylight and
set out eastward to get it. They took fifteen strings of dried clams with
them. They went as far as possible in a canoe. Then Mink left the two
others and gave them the fifteen strings of clams which were to last
fifteen days. He went off alone and made himself so old that he could
hardly walk. As soon as Mink had left,  Raven sent Sole away and in
three days ate all the clams.
<p>

Mink came to the man who had the daylight and who was the chief
of the tribe. Mink told the man, " I am the oldest brother of your father,
in time of war the people took me away with them. Now I have come
back to see you. " The man with the daylight believed what Mink said.
Meanwhile Mink was watching how the man controlled the sun. It was
like a clock. The man called his people together and told what Mink
had said.
<p>

There were three different keys used in winding the clock and Mink
found out how to work them. Then while the people were still asleep
Mink stole the clock. He took off the mask that made him look like an
old man. One of the people saw Mink go away. They chased him. Just as
Mink was tired out he met Raven who took the daylight and ran on.
The little boy Sole had the canoe in readiness. All three jumped aboard
and paddled away. The people could not follow because they had no
canoes.
<p>
Mink had the clock which was the sun wrapped up. He went t
grandmother's where he lived. She said, " What is Mink doing ? He co
not get daylight. " Mink made the sun work and it became daylight.

<p>
The chief's daughter saw the daylight come. She went to Mink's house
and listened to the clock striking. The girl went to her father and said,
" Your cousin has secured the daylight. " Mink was a slave (footnote 1: among the Skagit.
They captured him east of the Mountains) before but
now the girl called him chief. There were two chiefs in this tribe, one
was the father of this girl. The one chief said to the other, " We will give
a feast and let Mink tell how he got the daylight. " They called him chief
too. At first Mink said that he did not want to be chief and stayed a
slave. He locked himself up in his house and the chief sent his daughter
to listen all night. Mink knew that the girl was outside. He went out.
The girl wanted to marry him and followed him indoors. She watched
him wind up the clock with the three keys in the morning. After winding
with the third key the sun rose.

<p>
Mink said to the girl, " Go to your father and make him call all the
people together. " The people came and Mink said to them, "If you are
going to call me slave all the time then I shall take the daylight back
to the east, but if you call me chief I will leave the daylight here." The
chief put the matter up to the people. They voted that Mink should
become chief in place of the old chief. The old chief gave his daughter
to Mink and said, " Bring Mink into the house and he will now be our
head man... (footnote 2: this tale is unfinished)

`
<b>A system of symbols</b><br>

<div>A religion is a <b>system of symbols
which acts to </b>establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods
and motivations in
men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
clothing those conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the
moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.</div>


<br>
Such a tremendous weight is being put on the term "symbol" here
that our first move must be to decide with some precision what we are
going to mean by it. This is no easy task, for, rather like "culture,"
"symbol" has been used to refer to a great variety of things, often a
number of them at the same time.
<p>
In some hands it is used for anything which signifies something else
to someone: dark clouds are the symbolic precursors of an on-coming
rain. In others it is used only for explicitly conventional signs of one
sort or another: a red flag is a symbol of danger, a white of surrender.
In others it is confined to something which expresses in an oblique and
figurative manner that which cannot be stated in a direct and literal one,
so that there are symbols in poetry but not in science, and symbolic
logic is misnamed. In yet others, however, it is used for any object, act,
event, quality, or relation which serves as a vehicle .for a conception—
the conception is the symbol's "meaning"—and that is the approach I
shall follow here.  (See 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Langer" target="_blank">Langer, Philosophy in a New Key</a>.)
<p>

The number 6, written, imagined, laid out as a row of stones, or even
punched into the program tapes of a computer, is a symbol. But so also
is the Cross, talked about, visualized, shaped worriedly in air or
fondly fingered at the neck, the expanse of painted canvas called
"Guernica" or the bit of painted stone called a churinga, the word
"reality," or even the morpheme "-ing." They are all symbols, or at
least symbolic elements, because they are tangible formulations of
notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms,
concrete embodiments of ideas, attitudes, judgments, longings, or
beliefs.  To undertake the study of cultural activity—activity in
which symbolism forms the positive content—is thus not to abandon
social analysis for a Platonic cave of shadows, to enter into a
mentalistic world of introspective psychology or, worse, speculative
philosophy, and wander there forever in a haze of "Cognitions,"
"Affections," "Conations," and other elusive entities. Cultural acts,
the construction, apprehension, and utilization of symbolic forms, are
social events like any other; they are as public as marriage and as
observable as agriculture.
<p>
They are not, however, exactly the same thing; or, more precisely,
the symbolic dimension of social events is, like the psychological, itself
theoretically abstractable from those events as empirical totalities.
There is still, to paraphrase a remark of Kenneth Burke's, a difference
between building a house and drawing up a plan for building a house,
and reading a poem about having children by marriage is not quite the
same thing as having children by marriage.
<p>

Even though the building of the house may proceed under the guidance
of the plan or—a less likely occurrence—the having of children may be
motivated by a reading of the poem, there is something to be said for
not confusing our traffic with symbols with our traffic with objects
or human beings, for these latter are not in themselves symbols,
however often they may function as such.
<p>

No matter how deeply interfused the cultural, the social, and the
psychological may be in the everyday life of houses, farms, poems, and
marriages, it is useful to distinguish them in analysis, and, so
doing, to isolate the generic traits of each against the normalized
background of the other two. So far as culture patterns, that is,
systems or complexes of symbols, are concerned, the generic trait
which is of first importance for us here is that they are extrinsic
sources of information. By "extrinsic," I mean only that—unlike genes,
for example—they lie outside the boundaries of the individual organism
as such in that intersubjective world of common understandings into
which all human individuals are born, in which they pursue their
separate careers, and which they leave persisting behind them after
they die.

<p>By "sources of information," I mean only that—like
genes—they provide a blueprint or template in terms of which processes
external to themselves can be given a definite form. As the order of
bases in a strand of DNA forms a coded program, a set of instructions,
or a recipe, for the synthesis of the structurally complex proteins
which shape organic functioning, so culture patterns provide such
programs for the institution of the social and psychological processes
which shape public behavior. Though the sort of information and the
mode of its transmission are vastly different in the two cases, this
comparison of gene and symbol is more than a strained analogy of the
familiar "social heredity" sort. It is actually a substantial
relationship, for it is precisely because of the fact that genetically
programmed processes are so highly generalized in men, as compared
with lower animals, that culturally programmed ones are so important; only because
human behavior is so loosely determined by intrinsic sources of information that extrinsic sources are so vital. To build a dam a beaver
needs only an appropriate site and the proper materials—his mode of
procedure is shaped by his physiology.

<p>But man, whose genes are silent on the building trades, needs also
a conception of what it is to build a dam, a conception he can get
only from some symbolic source—a blueprint, a textbook, or a string of
speech by someone who already knows how dams are built—or, of course,
from manipulating graphic or linguistic elements in such a way as to
attain for himself a conception of what dams are and how they are
built.  This point is sometimes put in the form of an argument that
cultural patterns are "models," that they are sets of symbols whose
relations to one another "model" relations among entities, processes
or what-haveyou in physical, organic, social, or psychological systems
by "paralleling," "imitating," or "simulating" them.8

<p> The term "model" has, however, two senses—an "of" sense and a
"for" sense—and though these are but aspects of the same basic concept
they are very much worth distinguishing for analytic purposes. In the
first, what is stressed is the manipulation of symbol structures so as
to bring them, more or less closely, into parallel with the
pre-established nonsymbolic system, as when we grasp how dams work by
developing a theory of hydraulics or constructing a flow chart. The
theory or chart models physical relationships in such a way—that is,
by expressing their structure in synoptic form—as to render them
apprehensible; it is a model of "reality." In the second, what is
stressed is the manipulation of the nonsymbolic systems in terms of
the relationships expressed in the symbolic, as when we construct a
dam according to the specifications implied in an hydraulic theory or
the conclusions drawn from a flow chart. Here, the theory is a model
under whose guidance physical relationships are organized: it is a
model for "reality." For psychological and social systems, and for
cultural models that we would not ordinarily refer to as "theories,"
but rather as "doctrines," "melodies," or "rites," the case is in no
way different. Unlike genes, and other nonsymbolic information
sources, which are only models for, not models of, culture patterns
have an intrinsic double aspect: they give meaning, that is, objective
conceptual form, to social and psychological reality both by shaping
themselves to it and by shaping it to themselves.

<p> ther sorts of significative forms. Models for are found, as the
gene example suggests, through the whole order of nature; for wherever
there is a communication of pattern, such programs are, in simple
logic, required. Among animals, imprint learning is perhaps the most
striking example, because what such learning involves is the automatic
presentation of an appropriate sequence of behavior by a model animal
in the presence of a learning animal which serves, equally
automatically, to call out and stabilize a certain set of responses
genetically built into the learning animal.9 The communicative dance
of two bees, one of which has found nectar and the other of which
seeks it, is another, somewhat different, more complexly coded,
example.10 Craik has even suggested that the thin trickle of water
which first finds its way down from a mountain spring to the sea and
smooths a little channel for the greater volume of water that follows
after it plays a sort of model for function.11 But models
of—linguistic, graphic, mechanical, natural, etc., processes which
function not to provide sources of information in terms of which other
processes can be patterned, but to represent those patterned processes
as such, to express their structure in an alternative medium—are much
rarer and may perhaps be confined, among living animals, to man. The
perception of the structural congruence between one set of processes,
activities, relations, entities, and so on, and another set for which
it acts as a program, so that the program can be taken as a
representation, or conception—a symbol—of the programmed, is the
essence of human thought. The intertransposability of models for and
models of which symbolic formulation makes possible is the distinctive
characteristic of our mentality.

<b>Moods and Motivations</b><p>

<div>A religion is a system of symbols
which acts to <b>establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods
and motivations in
men </b>by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and
clothing those conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the
moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic.</div>

So far as religious symbols and symbol systems are concerned this
intertransposability is clear. The endurance, courage, independence,
perseverance, and passionate willfulness in which the vision quest
practices the Plains Indian are the same flamboyant virtues by which
he attempts to live: while achieving a sense of revelation he
stabilizes a sense of direction. The consciousness of defaulted
obligation, secreted guilt, and, when a confession is obtained, public
shame in which Manus' seance rehearses him are the same sentiments
that underlie the sort of duty ethic by which his property-conscious
society is maintained: the gaining of an absolution involves the
forging of a conscience.13 And the same self-discipline which rewards
a Javanese mystic staring fixedly into the flame of a lamp with what
he takes to be an intimation of divinity drills him in that rigorous
control of emotional expression which is necessary to a man who would
follow a quietistic style of life.14 Whether one sees the conception
of a personal guardian spirit, a family tutelary, or an immanent God
as synoptic formulations of the character of reality or as templates
for producing reality with such a character seems largely arbitrary, a
matter of which aspect, the model of or model for, one wants for the
moment to bring into focus. The concrete symbols involved--one or
another mythological figure materializing in the wilderness, the skull
of the deceased household head hanging censoriously in the rafters, or
a disembodied "voice in the stillness" soundlessly chanting enigmatic
classical poetry--point in either direction. They both express the
world's climate and shape it.

<p> 

They shape it by inducing in the worshipper a certain distinctive set
of dispositions (tendencies, capacities, propensities, skills, habits,
liabilities, pronenesses) which lend a chronic character to the flow
of his activity and the quality of his experience. A disposition
describes not an activity or an occurrence but a probability of an
activity being performed or an occurrence occurring in certain
circumstances: "When a cow is said to be a ruminant, or a man is said
to be a cigarette-smoker, it is not being said that the cow is
ruminating now or that the man is smoking a cigarette now. To be a
ruminant is to tend to ruminate from time to time, and to be a
cigarette-smoker is to be in the habit of smoking cigarettes."15
Similarly, to be pious is not to be performing something we would call
an act of piety, but to be liable to perform such acts. So, too, with
the Plains Indian's bravura, the Manus' compunctiousness, or the
Javanese's quietism, which, in their contexts, form the substance of
piety. The virtue of this sort of view of what are usually called
"mental traits" or, if the Cartesianism is unavowed, "psychological
forces" (both unobjectionable enough terms in themselves) is that it
gets them out of any dim and inaccessible realm of private sensation
into that same well-lit world of observables in which reside the
brittleness of glass, the inflammability of paper, and, to return to
the metaphor, the dampness of England.
<p>

So far as religious activities are concerned (and learning a myth by
heart is as much a religious activity as detaching one's finger at the
knuckle), two somewhat different sorts of disposition are induced by
them: moods and motivations.

<p> 

A motivation is a persisting tendency, a chronic inclination to
perform certain sorts of acts and experience certain sorts of feeling
in certain sorts of situations, the "sorts" being commonly very
heterogenous and rather ill-defined classes in all three cases:
<p>

On hearing that a man is vain [i.e., motivated by vanity] we expect
him to behave in certain ways, namely to talk a lot about himself, to
cleave to the society of the eminent, to reject criticisms, to seek
the footlights and to disengage himself from conversations about the
merits of others. We expect him to indulge in roseate daydreams about
his own successes, to avoid recalling past failures and to plan for
his own advancement. To be vain is to tend to act in these and
innumerable other kindred ways. Certainly we also expect the vain man
to feel certain pangs and flutters in certain situations; we expect
him to have an acute sinking feeling when an eminent person forgets
his name, and to feel buoyant of heart and light of toe on hearing of
the misfortunes of his rivals. But feelings of pique and buoyancy are
not more directly indicative of vanity than are public acts of
boasting or private acts of daydreaming.16
<p>

Similarly for any motivations. As a motive, "flamboyant courage"
consists in such enduring propensities as to fast in the wilderness,
to conduct solitary raids on enemy camps, and to thrill to the thought
of counting coup. "Moral circumspection" consists in such ingrained
tendencies as to honor onerous promises, to confess secret sins in the
face of severe public disapproval, and to feel guilty when vague and
generalized accusations are made at seances. And "dispassionate
tranquility" consists in such persistent inclinations as to maintain
one's poise come hell or high water, to experience distaste in the
presence of even moderate emotional displays, and to indulge in
contentless contemplations of featureless objects. Motives are thus
neither acts (that is, intentional behaviors) nor feelings, but
liabilities to perform particular classes of act or have particular
classes of feeling. And when we say that a man is religious, that is,
motivated by religion, this is at least part--though only part--of
what we mean.

<p> 

Another part of what we mean is that he has, when properly stimulated,
a susceptibility to fall into certain moods, moods we sometimes lump
together under such covering terms as "reverential," "solemn," or
"worshipful." Such generalized rubrics actually conceal, however, the
enormous empirical variousness of the dispositions involved, and, in
fact, tend to assimilate them to the unusually grave tone of most of
our own religious life. The moods that sacred symbols induce, at
different times and in different places, range from exultation to
melancholy, from self-confidence to self-pity, from an incorrigible
playfulness to a bland listlessness--to say nothing of the erogenous
power of so many of the world's myths and rituals. No more than there
is a single sort of motivation one can call piety is there a single
sort of mood one can call worshipful.

 
<p>

The major difference between moods and motivations is that where the
latter are, so to speak, vectorial qualities, the former are merely
scalar. Motives have a directional cast, they describe a certain
overall course, gravitate toward certain, usually temporary,
consummations. But moods vary only as to intensity: they go
nowhere. They spring from certain circumstances but they are
responsive to no ends. Like fogs, they just settle and lift; like
scents, suffuse and evaporate. When present they are totalistic: if
one is sad everything and everybody seems dreary; if one is gay,
everything and everybody seems splendid. Thus, though a man can be
vain, brave, willful, and independent at the same time, he can't very
well be playful and listless, or exultant and melancholy, at the same
time.17 Further, where motives persist for more or less extended
periods of time, moods merely recur with greater or lesser frequency,
coming and going for what are often quite unfathomable reasons. But
perhaps the most important difference, so far as we are concerned,
between moods and motivations is that motivations are "made
meaningful" with reference to the ends toward which they are conceived
to conduce, whereas moods are "made meaningful" with reference to the
conditions from which they are conceived to spring. We interpret
motives in terms of their consummations, but we interpret moods in
terms of their sources. We say that a person is industrious because he
wishes to succeed; we say that a person is worried because he is
conscious of the hanging threat of nuclear holocaust. And this is no
less the case when the interpretations are ultimate. Charity becomes
Christian charity when it is enclosed in a conception of God's
purposes; optimism is Christian optimism when it is grounded in a
particular conception of God's nature. The assiduity of the Navaho
finds its rationale in a belief that, since "reality" operates
mechanically, it is coercible; their chronic fearfulness finds its
rationale in a conviction that, however "reality" operates, it is both
enormously powerful and terribly dangerous.

"butler-gender-trouble":
`
Gender Trouble</h4>

The term gender performativity was first coined by American
philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler in their 1990 book
Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. In the
book, Butler sets out to criticize what they consider to be an
outdated perception of gender. This outdated perception, according to
Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal
constraints that label gender as binary.

<p>In scrutinizing gender,
Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which they unite the
concepts of performativity and gender. In chapter one, Butler
introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in
stating that "gender proves to be performance—that is, constituting
the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a
doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist
the deed".
<p>

Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the
terms gender performance and gender performativity. In a 2011
interview, Butler stated it this way, in <u>Your Behavior Creates Your Gender</u> (2011)


<blockquote>

When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken
on a role; we're acting in some way... To say that gender is
performative is a little different, because for something to be
performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and
walk and speak and talk in ways that consolidate an impression of
being a man or being a woman... We act as if that being of a man or
that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or something
that's simply true about us, a fact about us. Actually, it's a
phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the
time, so to say gender is performative is to say that nobody really is
a gender from the start.[68]
</blockquote>


Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of
acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal
norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of
performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead,
what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of
an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing
the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what
produces the individual.

wikipedia</a>

In psychology and ethology, imprinting is any kind of phase-sensitive
learning (learning occurring at a particular age or a particular life
stage) that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of
behaviour. <p>

It was first used to describe situations in which an animal
or person learns the characteristics of some stimulus, which is
therefore said to be "imprinted" onto the subject. Imprinting is
hypothesized to have a critical period.

<p>
In humans, where much of our understanding and skill are learned,
and relatively little is inherent - like beaver dam construction, for instance,
or the bee dance - that imprinting, of many kinds, shape a significant
amount of the human perception, and human life.

</ul>

<blockquote>

Is a god, or any divine power, only a mirage of the human-made
political structures that oppress us? This understanding of religion,
popularized by 19th-century thinkers like Karl Marx and Émile
Durkheim, has become received wisdom among the anthropologists and
sociologists studying the origins and functions of religious life. We
sense that we live under forces of authority that constrain us, and
yet we cannot precisely locate or understand them. Needing to give
some shape or form to this coercion, we project it onto the clouds,
fashioning heavenly beings that are ultimately deifications of the
human state. “Religion is realistic,” Durkheim noted; it corresponds
to our social realities and reinforces them.
<p>

Yet the existence of societies without chiefs or kings, or any
vertical political organization, challenges this picture. In
communities that traditionally recognized no rulers or government,
from Tierra del Fuego to the Central Arctic to the Philippines, we
still find complex concepts of celestial hierarchies, metahuman
authorities, and bureaucracies of deities and spirits with no
correspondence to the human social order. Where do these ideas come
from, which reflect no living conditions on the ground? How is it that
notions of the state seem to be anticipated by cosmology before they
are realized in society?
<p>

These questions lie at the heart of Marshall Sahlins’s final book, The
New Science of the Enchanted Universe: An Anthropology of Most of
Humanity. Across most cultures, Sahlins observes, human life unfolds
in continuous reference to other beings—supreme gods and minor
deities, ancestral spirits, demons, indwelling souls in animals and
plants—who act as the intimate, everyday agents of human success or
ruin, whether in agriculture, hunting, procreation, or politics. These
not-quite humans, or metapersons, can be found across all landscapes,
from the Chewong “leaf people” in the Malay Peninsula to the Greenland
Inuits, who had the idea that spirits animate each human joint and
knuckle. Indigenous communities possess empirical knowledge about
these spirit worlds, yet anthropologists often use the language of
“belief”—or worse, “folk belief”—to describe them, an approach loaded
with their own disbelief. Rejecting the obscurant category of
“belief,” Sahlins asks: What if we saw metapersons as worthy of a
science of their own? If we examine them as a ubiquitous global
presence, and attempt to tease out general theories about their role
in human political and economic life, what would this new science
teach us?
<p>

Published posthumously, The New Science of the Enchanted Universe is
riveting, and this is in part because Sahlins writes with an
incantatory, late-style openness to the existence of metapersons—just
as he began to turn into an ancestral spirit himself. In the late
autumn of 2020, Sahlins had become paralyzed after a fall; not long
before his 90th birthday, he slipped into a dissociative state and was
given days to live. Yet he soon surfaced from the hereafter,
determined to finish the manuscript. Having lost the use of both
hands, over the next few months he dictated it to his son, the
historian Peter Sahlins, and completed it a month before his
death. The book (“my swan song,” as he calls it in the preface) is
electrified by ideas—of human finitude and eternity, the interlacing
of the political, the enchanted, and the divine—that Sahlins, even
near his end, could not lay to rest.
<p>

If Marshall Sahlins had a faith of his own, it was humor. Born in 1930
in Chicago, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Sahlins was raised
in a secular household, although his family counted among its
ancestors the 18th-century Jewish mystic Ba’al Shem Tov, the founder
of Hasidic Judaism, who was famous for his laughter during a Passover
seder. This contagious, charismatic wit was something of a family
inheritance—his brother Bernard Sahlins later became a comedian, while
Marshall became known for a mix of mischief and polemic that ignited
conversations as well as the written page. He studied anthropology at
the University of Michigan, sailed through a PhD at Columbia in two
years, and then returned to Michigan to teach.
<p>

In those years, Sahlins was an evolutionary materialist, interested in
how cultures evolve alongside technological progress. His
dissertation, Social Stratification in Polynesia, took this approach,
looking at how cultural difference arises through environmental and
economic factors. Yet by the mid-1960s, the United States’ disastrous
war in Vietnam had shattered the technological determinism that
Sahlins was taught in school and revealed to him how ways of
understanding cultural progress are often at the behest of empire. As
Sahlins recalled in an interview, he became interested in what he
called “the indigenization of modernity,” the ways in which peoples
attempt “to engage the encroaching ‘World System’ in something even
more encompassing—their own system of the world.” He had observed this
phenomenon during fieldwork on the island of Moala in Fiji in 1955,
when he studied how chiefly lineages adapted to new orders of power.
<p>

The 1960s were a transformative period for Sahlins, intensifying his
left-leaning commitments and sharpening his political activism. Amid
the upheavals in the United States and Vietnam, Sahlins detected “a
clear and simple law of revolution”: that it is the rulers, not the
revolutionaries, who undermine a society’s culture and principles of
government. “It is from deep traditional values that the opposition
draws its outrage—and in defense of them, takes to the streets,” he
later reflected in a collection of political essays, Culture in
Practice. At an all-night protest in Ann Arbor in 1965, Sahlins led
the first anti–Vietnam War “teach-in” and is often credited as the
inventor of the concept, which took college campuses by storm. Soon
after, he organized a national teach-in of thousands of students in
Washington, D.C., and the following year he flew to Vietnam, where he
taped a set of darkly absurd dialogues with American
operatives—“hard-headed surrealists,” as he called them.
<p>

In 1968, Sahlins moved to Paris to participate in the famed
anthropological laboratoire of Claude Lévi-Strauss, and he also
witnessed the mass student protests and workers’ strikes that
year. Inspired by the collective uprising, he sought to adapt
Lévi-Strauss’s theory of structuralism, of how symbols, patterns, and
binaries form the building blocks and hidden laws that structure human
thought. What happens when these structures collide with a
revolutionary present? How do individuals become agents of historical
change? Amid the labor strikes, Sahlins was also contemplating how
leisurely life must have been in the Paleolithic period. In his essay
“The Original Affluent Society,” he argued that hunter-gatherers lived
not in hardscrabble misery, on the edge of starvation, but in
prosperity.
<p>

“There is,” Sahlins wrote, “a Zen road to affluence, departing from
premises somewhat different from our own: that human material wants
are finite and few.” Among pre-agricultural tribes, Sahlins
calculated, food acquisition took only three to five hours per day,
leaving plenty of time for feasting, recreation, and sleep. In
contrast, “the market-industrial system institutes scarcity, in a
manner completely unparalleled,” as it requires insufficiency as the
foundation of all economic activity. Poverty, Sahlins wrote, is above
all “a relation between people. Poverty is a social status. As such,
it is the invention of civilization,” which forges tributary
relationships between classes. Sahlins developed these ideas in Stone
Age Economics (1972), a book that, half a century later, remains a
prophetic call for degrowth amid the current climate collapse.
<p>

For Sahlins, Indigenous cultures offered profound counterpoints for
how humans might live, a theme he continued to develop after his move
in 1973 to the University of Chicago, where he remained for nearly 50
years. In Islands of History, he began to investigate how divinity
intersects with cultural structures and historic events—most
notoriously through the fate of James Cook. In 1779, when Captain Cook
landed on Hawaii, he was reportedly hailed as the god Lono, and a
rapturous crowd of thousands offered him sacrifices. Yet when Cook
stepped ashore a second time, after his ship was damaged in a storm,
he was slain; Sahlins argued that this was because Cook was
inadvertently playing out the script of a myth held by the islanders
that when the god returns, he must act out a battle with the king. To
the anthropologist Gananath Obeyesekere, Sahlins’s analysis was
exoticizing and patronizing, for it denied Hawaiians common sense: Why
would Polynesians mistake a Yorkshireman for their own god? For
Obeyesekere, what he called “practical rationality” was universal,
while Sahlins argued for its cultural specificity in his 1995
book-length reply, How “Natives” Think (About Captain Cook, for
Example). On Hawaii, Sahlins wrote, “politics appears as the
continuation of cosmogonic war by other means.”
<p>

These ideas deepened through Sahlins’s ongoing dialogue with a
luminous former student, the author and activist David Graeber, who
died less than a year before his teacher. In 2017, Sahlins and Graeber
published the monumental On Kings, in which they argued that the
structures of sacred kingship have never vanished from modern politics
or our institutions of “popular” sovereignty. Throughout On Kings,
supra-human beings continuously appear, ever setting “the terms and
conditions of human existence.” One even appears on its cover: the
frontispiece of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan, depicting the crowned
monarch rising above the human landscape, his body made of myriad tiny
persons who blur together like a scaly coat of armor. The image
reveals how metapersons have penetrated the conceptualization of the
state in Western traditions often deemed the apex of rational, secular
thought. The essence of political power, Sahlins and Graeber wrote,
“is the ability to act as if one were a god; to step outside the
confines of the human, and return to rain favor, or destruction.” It
must have been while he was writing On Kings that the metapersons
approached Sahlins and requested, or demanded, that he devote an
entire book to them.

<p>
The New Science of the Enchanted Universe takes as its starting point
perhaps the earliest cultural revolution, that of the “Axial Age,” the
period between the eighth and third centuries BCE in which the
civilizations of Greece, the Near East, India, and China underwent a
seismic shift. Notions of divinity, Sahlins tells us, moved “from an
immanent presence in human activity to a transcendental ‘other world’
of its own reality,” creating the foundations for the Vedic, Buddhist,
Judaic, and (later) Christian and Islamic religions. In the
disenchanting exodus of transcendence, the high gods and spirits
evacuated to the upper echelons of the sky, “leaving the earth alone
to humans, now free to create their own institutions by their own
means and lights.” In societies that remained enchanted, the legions
of metapersons continued to be “the decisive agents of human weal and
woe,” and what we would call “culture” was still not considered “a
human thing.” In contrast, in the transcendental societies, culture
became humankind’s own invention, a domain entirely under our control.
<p>


In what Sahlins calls the “Second Axial Age,” rooted in the doctrinal
wars and imperialist conquests of the early modern period from the
15th through the 19th centuries, European civilization forged a set of
abstract, differentiated spheres—“religion,” “politics,” “economics,”
“culture,” “science,” and “nature”—that created further distance from
the once-enchanted cosmos. The realm of the economy came to be seen as
the base of the pyramid of quotidian life, while divinity moved from
being the infrastructure to the superstructure. With each axial turn
came a host of intractable theological dilemmas; throughout the book,
the immanentist perspective emerges as the most intuitive, as it
escapes the perennial problem of theodicy—of why an infinitely
benevolent Almighty would cause so much harm to mortals, or even get
involved in their minutiae—that plagues transcendentalism.
<p>

In The New Science, Sahlins attempts to convene a vivid conference of
metapersons and let them speak, without imposing the distorting
transcendentalist categories upon them. These familiar binaries—of
“natural” versus “supernatural,” “material” versus “spiritual,”
“secular” versus “religious”—make no sense, he argues, as a way to
understand the halibut master of species that brokers deals with
Kwakiutl fishermen in the Pacific Northwest. For ancient Sumerians,
minerals like salt were alive, with opinions of their own. BaKongo
people had a practice of shaving the head to keep it clear and smooth
“for spirits that might want to land there,” as the anthropologist
Wyatt MacGaffey reported. It is not surprising, given the huge range
of ways to suffer, that demons tend to be the most diverse and heavily
populated class of metahumans: The Chewong recognize 27 different
types. “All that exists lives,” a Siberian Chukchee shaman told the
Russian ethnographer Waldemar Bogoras. “The lamp walks around. The
walls of the house have voices of their own…. Even the shadows on the
wall constitute definite tribes and have their own country, where they
live in huts and subsist by hunting.”
<p>

The Chukchee, descended from nomadic hunter-gatherers, are among what
Sahlins calls the “so-called tribes without rulers” who historically
lacked vertical political structures yet knew entrenched cosmic forms
of authority. In the early 20th century, the shaman described to
Bogoras how they were subjugated to hosts of invisible, mercenary
spirits with whom they had to forge alliances or pay ransoms for
protection. One might theorize that cosmic polities are modeled, if
not around earthly political coercion, then after patriarchy within
the unit of the human family itself. Yet even in communities that
prize familial relationships of equality, Sahlins notes, such as the
Buid of Mindoro in the Philippines, we find strongly hierarchical
concepts of the metahuman world that in no way reflect their equitable
mode of life. Sahlins particularly focuses on geographically isolated
groups uninfluenced by transcendentalist missionaries, such as the
subarctic Naskapi in what is now northern Canada, who acquiesce to no
authority except the overlord Moose-Fly. Flanked by his avatars, the
stinging moose-flies that appear during the summer salmon-fishing
season, Moose-Fly rules over the fish tribes upon whom Naskapi life
depends. Humans must obey his laws, such as never making fun of a fish
for its big eyes.
<p>

“The state of nature had the nature of the state,” as Sahlins put it
in a companion essay in the volume Sacred Kingship in World History
(2022). If immanence was the original human condition out of which
transcendentalist civilizations arose, it follows that a hierarchical
cosmology was already in place from the beginning—almost as if
originating from a source that preexisted human life. This possibility
is furthered by the existence of utterly random, bizarre laws that
seem to serve no human function (the United States has many). In The
New Science, Sahlins compares the Inuit “rules of life” recorded in
Baffin Land in the 1920s—“If a woman sees a whale, she must point to
it with her middle finger”—to an ancient Akkadian list of
commandments, including that one must never point at a lamp. Even
where there is no clear moral content, what is at stake is obedience
to the higher metapersonal powers, in a deference “even better served
by ‘irrationality,’” a pattern replicated in the whims of autocrats
today. If “power descends from heaven to earth,” Sahlins writes,
“human political power is necessarily and quintessentially hubris, the
appropriation of divinity in one form or another.” The charisma of
politicians is always given by the gods, such as the mana handed down
to legions of Melanesian chiefs. In his essay, Sahlins touches upon
the interesting point that hubris, or overstepping the boundaries
between the human and the divine, also underlies structures of class,
with elites often seen as possessing or appropriating spirit-power. In
turn, any emancipatory movement must mobilize the metahuman as “the
necessary precedent of political action.”
<p>

Sahlins has an eye for profound, poetic details and writes with a deep
empathy, as someone who is constantly moved by the ideas and
worldviews he encounters. Yet his project is tricky, as he still can’t
help but fall back on the transcendental language of culture,
politics, and science that he is familiar with to communicate what he
wants to say. There is also always the anthropological danger of
heroizing such traditions in a way that reduces their complexities. At
times, The New Science risks falling into the same trap as the debate
with Obeyesekere did, of the attempt to unearth what people really
think (or worse, believe), for one will never truly know. One might
ask not only why ideas of the metapersons are so lasting and
compelling but also why the anthropological impulse to take them “on
their own terms,” even if this is impossible, endures. It remains a
powerful mode of political self-critique—and a kind of self-help, much
needed—of which Sahlins is a master, although it ultimately speaks
more to “the West” than anyplace else, confronting it with other ways
to live and face death.
<p>

In between roving from the Amazon to New Guinea, Sahlins might have
opened the door of his study to the many contemporary American
metapersons, from extraterrestrials and angels to imaginary friends in
childhood. Even in any allegedly disenchanted culture, the vestiges of
the immanent never disappear. We continue to live in a world crowded
with nonhuman persons, from commercial brands who speak in distinct
“voices” on Twitter, to currencies with their own agency, to the meat
shunned by vegans, as Sahlins observes, on the premise of “the
personhood of food.”

<p>
Along with demons, ancestral spirits—including the “recent familial
dead”—are an especially populous global demographic. Sahlins writes
beautifully of traditions in which the dead are kept close at hand. In
Kwaio settlements in the Solomon Islands, he relates, people spoke as
frequently to their dead relatives as to their living ones. During a
festival period in the Trobriand Islands off New Guinea, when the
baloma, or ancestral souls, are said to return, the deceased are so
closely present that the living must be careful not to spill hot
drinks or wave sticks in the air, lest they injure the
spirits. “‘Lineage’ as the participation of the ancestor in the bodies
and identities of living persons—as by the transmission of ‘blood,’
‘bone,’ or ‘soul’—is a spiritual condition,” Sahlins writes. He might
also have explored the American ritual of transmitting samples by
mail—to corporations such as Ancestry.com and 23andMe—as a way to find
lost ancestors and locate ourselves in the still-enchanted webs of
human kinship. For “humans are spirits too,” Sahlins reminds us.
<p>

When the academic reviews of The New Science of the Enchanted Universe
began to appear, following its publication a year after Sahlins’s
death, I noticed a strange phenomenon: For a genre conventionally
prosaic, the scholarly critics kept having encounters with the
metaperson of Sahlins himself. When Katherine Pratt Ewing, a professor
of Islam at Columbia University, sat down to write her review at her
dining table on a Sunday morning, she suddenly found herself slipping
into “an almost hypnagogic state in which Marshall was a felt
presence,” she recalled in HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory. “It
wasn’t a matter of belief about whether this was possible—it just
was.” Ewing later realized that Sahlins had appeared to her on the
morning of his memorial service, held at the University of Chicago on
April 3, 2022.
<p>

“I kept trying to imagine how he would take my comments,” the
anthropologist Carlos Fausto wrote in another piece for HAU. “Would he
act like a benevolent or a mean-spirited ancestor?” Ancestors, Sahlins
had wryly observed, are ambivalent powers, usually the most moralistic
of all metahuman types. They are needy, even though “they are not
actually in need of anything,” to quote the Swiss ethnographer Henri
Junod. At the memorial service, Sahlins’s former doctoral student Sean
Dowdy gave a eulogy, and he was certain—for a moment—that he saw
Sahlins sitting in the crowd, carrying himself with a shabby
dignity. Dowdy spoke of how the late professor had been appearing to
him in dreams. In one, Dowdy walked up the stairs to Sahlins’s house
on University Avenue. Sahlins opened the door wearing his usual
navy-blue sweater vest, greeted Dowdy with a smile, and asked him how
the mourning had been going.

<p>
It seemed to me that Sahlins, ever since his death, was continuing to
develop the arguments of The New Science in a new way. (The book was
meant to be a trilogy, if only Sahlins had more time.) The scholar
Frederick B. Henry Jr., another former student and longtime friend,
worked tirelessly to prepare the manuscript for publication. Henry
told me how, as he was driving down a highway in Princeton to an early
morning appointment, he suddenly realized that Marshall was sitting in
the passenger seat. He stayed there for 10 minutes, as Henry’s hair
stood on end and a wave of joy and sadness overcame him. “I found
myself belly-laughing at some unidentifiable joke he had manifested
beside me to deliver,” Henry recalled. Sahlins was inimitably
demonstrating his point, of the immediacy of the spirit world that
ever surrounds us. “It is the flip-side, behind the mirror of our
limited being,” Henry wrote to me. “None of it need be considered
paranormal in the slightest. It is part and parcel of our human
condition…. I will eventually become a metaperson, to someone. So will
you.”

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpellation_(philosophy)" target="_blank">wikpedia</a>: &nbsp;
Interpellation is a concept introduced to Marxist theory by Louis
Althusser as the mechanism through which pre-existing social
structures "constitute" (or construct) individual human organisms as
subjects (with consciousness and agency).

<p>
Althusser asked how people
come voluntarily to live within class, gender, racial or other
identities, and argued that this happens through "state apparatuses"
(such as the family, mass media, schools, churches, the judicial
system, police, government) continually telling individuals what they
are from infancy.
<p>
In this way, apparatuses maintain the social
order. In Althusser's view, apparatuses call us (or ‘hail’ us, French
<i>interpeller</i>) by labels, and we learn to respond to those labels. In
this structuralist philosophy, social structures constitute subjects
rather than individuals constituting their own subjectivity for
themselves. 

**Origin of the term**<p>

The term interpellation is more common in French, the language in
which Althusser originally introduced the concept, than English. It
comes from the French verb interpeller, meaning "call out [to
someone]", "speak (abruptly) [to get someone's attention, to request
something, or to insult someone]". This French verb also has several
technical legal senses: to pose questions when interrogating a
suspected criminal; to notify someone that they are legally obliged to
do something; or a parliamentary summons to someone to account for
themself. Thus in both French and English the noun interpellation
denotes the act of interpellating someone.

**Precursors**<p>

The German philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer employed a
method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in
their text Dialectic of Enlightenment, although they did so 26 years
before "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" was
published. Rather than situating their analysis heavily on the State,
Adorno and Horkheimer argued that the mass media—the "culture
industry"—also plays a role in the construction of passive
subjects. So unlike the police officer in Althusser's example who
reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media now plays
a powerful complementary role in the creation of a passive
consumer. However, whereas Althusser sought to make subjectivity a
mere epiphenomenon of institutional interpellation, Adorno and
Horkheimer insisted on a concept of subjectivity that was not limited
to an institutional definition. They sought to expose tendencies
favoring "total administration" over the individual and their
subjective potential, while Althusser's analysis seemed only to
confirm those tendencies.

**Overview**<p>

In "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an
Investigation)", Althusser introduces the concepts of ideological
state apparatuses (ISAs) and repressive state apparatuses (RSAs),
institutions which make up society and which are instrumental to the
constant reproduction of the relations of production in that
society. While RSAs are institutions that directly repress dissent and
opposition (for example, the police and the military), ISAs (for
example family, church, schools, the media and politics) reproduce
capitalism through non-repressive ideological means. Consequently,
interpellation describes the process by which ideology, embodied in
major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes
the very nature of individual subjects' identities.
<p>
Althusser sees interpellation as an act of "hailing" individuals
through social interactions: "all ideology hails or interpellates
concrete individuals as concrete subjects"; "ideology 'acts' or
'functions' in such a way that it ... 'transforms' the individual into
subjects". For Althusser, interpellation ("hailing") is a
non-specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police
officer shouts (or hails) "Hey, you there!" and an individual turns
around and, so-to-speak, 'answers' the call, the individual becomes a
subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has
realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him
subjective to the ideology of democracy and law.
Another example is of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside
asks "Who is there?" and only opens the door once the "It's me" from
the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes
in "a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday
life". In other words, Althusser's central thesis is that "you and
I are always already subjects" and are constantly engaging in everyday
rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us
subject to ideology.
<p>
Althusser argued that "there is no ideology except by the subject and
for the subject". This notion of subjectivity became central to his
thought. According to Althusser, "ideology has always-already
interpellated individuals", that is, individuals are constituted as
subjects through being interpellated from before they are even
born. He further remarks about the individual identity under these
conditions:

<blockquote>the individual is interpellated as a (free) subject in order that he
shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject, i.e. in order
that he shall (freely) accept his subjection, i.e. in order that he
shall make the gestures and actions of his subjection 'all by
himself'.
</blockquote>

Consequently, individual subjects are presented principally as
produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent
agents with self-produced identities. Althusser's argument here
strongly draws from Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror
stage. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the "I" (i.e.,
the conscious ego which is created by the mirror stage) and the
"subject" (that is, the symbolic subject of the unconscious),
Althusser collapses both concepts into one.

**Other applications**<p>

Althusser's thought has made significant contributions to other French
philosophers, notably Derrida, Kristeva, Barthes, Foucault, Deleuze,
and Badiou. The feminist scholar and queer theorist Judith Butler
critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight
the social construction of gender identities. Butler argues that by
hailing "It's a boy/girl," the newborn baby is ultimately positioned
as subject.
<p>

Media theorist David Gauntlett argues that "interpellation occurs when
a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV
show, for example, this uncritical consumption means that the text has
interpellated us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to
tacitly accept a particular approach to the world."

**Louis Pierre Althusser**<p>

1918 – 1990,  a French
Marxist philosopher who studied at the École normale supérieure in
Paris, where he eventually became Professor of Philosophy.

<p>

Althusser was a long-time member and sometimes a strong critic of the
French Communist Party (Parti communiste français, PCF). His arguments
and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the
theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence
of empiricism on Marxist theory, and humanist and reformist socialist
orientations which manifested as divisions in the European communist
parties, as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of
ideology. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist,
although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is
not a simple affiliation and he was critical of many aspects of
structuralism. He later described himself as a social anarchist.

<p>
Althusser's life was marked by periods of intense mental illness. In
1980, he killed his wife, the sociologist Hélène Rytmann, by
strangling her. He was declared unfit to stand trial due to insanity
and committed to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He did little
further academic work, dying in 1990.

_Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an

philosopher Louis Althusser. First published in 1970, it advances
Althusser's conception and critique of ideology.

<p>
Where Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels posited a thinly-sketched theory of ideology as a
system of falsehoods serving the ruling class,
Althusser draws upon the works of later theorists such as Antonio
Gramsci, Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to proffer a more elaborate
redefinition of the theory. Althusser's theory of ideology has
remained influential since it was written.

<b>Believing, with Max Weber ...</b>
<p>
In Chapter 1 of his 1973 essay collection, The Interpretation of Cultures,
Geertz states his aim:
<blockquote>
The concept of culture I espouse, and whose utility the
essays below attempt to demonstrate, is essentially a
semiotic one.
<p>
Believing, with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of
significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and
the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in
search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning.
</blockquote>
<p>
He elaborates:
<blockquote>
It is
explication I am after, construing social expressions on their surface
enigmatical.
And it is not even, finally, meanings that I am after,
but rather significances.

<p>Culture is not a power, something to which
social events, behaviors, institutions, or processes can be causally
attributed; it is a context, something within which they can be
intelligibly— that is, thickly— described. In brief, a little thicker
description is what we need in this life, and that is what, I am here
to argue, ethnography, properly conceived as a thick description of
particular social situations, does indeed provide.

<p>The task of the
ethnographer is to make the familiar strange and the strange familiar,
to take, as it were, the native's point of view, to get inside his
head and see the world the way he does, to delineate the ethos of his
culture as that ethos is manifested in actual behavior.

**Religion as a Symbolic System**


Geertz defines religion as:

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<details>
   <summary>a system of symbols which acts to</summary>

<br>
Such a tremendous weight is being put on the term "symbol" here
that our first move must be to decide with some precision what we are
going to mean by it. This is no easy task, for, rather like "culture,"
"symbol" has been used to refer to a great variety of things, often a
number of them at the same time.
<p>
In some hands it is used for anything which signifies something else
to someone: dark clouds are the symbolic precursors of an on-coming
rain. In others it is used only for explicitly conventional signs of one
sort or another: a red flag is a symbol of danger, a white of surrender.
In others it is confined to something which expresses in an oblique and
figurative manner that which cannot be stated in a direct and literal one,
so that there are symbols in poetry but not in science, and symbolic
logic is misnamed. In yet others, however, it is used for any object, act,
event, quality, or relation which serves as a vehicle .for a conception—
the conception is the symbol's "meaning"—and that is the approach I
shall follow here.  (See 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanne_Langer" target="_blank">Langer, Philosophy in a New Key</a>.)
<p>

The number 6, written, imagined, laid out as a row of stones, or even
punched into the program tapes of a computer, is a symbol. But so also
is the Cross, talked about, visualized, shaped worriedly in air or
fondly fingered at the neck, the expanse of painted canvas called
"Guernica" or the bit of painted stone called a churinga, the word
"reality," or even the morpheme "-ing." They are all symbols, or at
least symbolic elements, because they are tangible formulations of
notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms,
concrete embodiments of ideas, attitudes, judgments, longings, or
beliefs.  To undertake the study of cultural activity—activity in
which symbolism forms the positive content—is thus not to abandon
social analysis for a Platonic cave of shadows, to enter into a
mentalistic world of introspective psychology or, worse, speculative
philosophy, and wander there forever in a haze of "Cognitions,"
"Affections," "Conations," and other elusive entities. Cultural acts,
the construction, apprehension, and utilization of symbolic forms, are
social events like any other; they are as public as marriage and as
observable as agriculture.
<p>
They are not, however, exactly the same thing; or, more precisely,
the symbolic dimension of social events is, like the psychological, itself
theoretically abstractable from those events as empirical totalities.
There is still, to paraphrase a remark of Kenneth Burke's, a difference
between building a house and drawing up a plan for building a house,
and reading a poem about having children by marriage is not quite the
same thing as having children by marriage.
<p>

Even though the building of the house may proceed under the guidance
of the plan or—a less likely occurrence—the having of children may be
motivated by a reading of the poem, there is something to be said for
not confusing our traffic with symbols with our traffic with objects
or human beings, for these latter are not in themselves symbols,
however often they may function as such.
<p>

No matter how deeply interfused the cultural, the social, and the
psychological may be in the everyday life of houses, farms, poems, and
marriages, it is useful to distinguish them in analysis, and, so
doing, to isolate the generic traits of each against the normalized
background of the other two. So far as culture patterns, that is,
systems or complexes of symbols, are concerned, the generic trait
which is of first importance for us here is that they are extrinsic
sources of information. By "extrinsic," I mean only that—unlike genes,
for example—they lie outside the boundaries of the individual organism
as such in that intersubjective world of common understandings into
which all human individuals are born, in which they pursue their
separate careers, and which they leave persisting behind them after
they die.

<p>By "sources of information," I mean only that—like
genes—they provide a blueprint or template in terms of which processes
external to themselves can be given a definite form. As the order of
bases in a strand of DNA forms a coded program, a set of instructions,
or a recipe, for the synthesis of the structurally complex proteins
which shape organic functioning, so culture patterns provide such
programs for the institution of the social and psychological processes
which shape public behavior. Though the sort of information and the
mode of its transmission are vastly different in the two cases, this
comparison of gene and symbol is more than a strained analogy of the
familiar "social heredity" sort. It is actually a substantial
relationship, for it is precisely because of the fact that genetically
programmed processes are so highly generalized in men, as compared
with lower animals, that culturally programmed ones are so important; only because
human behavior is so loosely determined by intrinsic sources of information that extrinsic sources are so vital. To build a dam a beaver
needs only an appropriate site and the proper materials—his mode of
procedure is shaped by his physiology.

<p>But man, whose genes are silent on the building trades, needs also
a conception of what it is to build a dam, a conception he can get
only from some symbolic source—a blueprint, a textbook, or a string of
speech by someone who already knows how dams are built—or, of course,
from manipulating graphic or linguistic elements in such a way as to
attain for himself a conception of what dams are and how they are
built.  This point is sometimes put in the form of an argument that
cultural patterns are "models," that they are sets of symbols whose
relations to one another "model" relations among entities, processes
or what-haveyou in physical, organic, social, or psychological systems
by "paralleling," "imitating," or "simulating" them.8

<p> The term "model" has, however, two senses—an "of" sense and a
"for" sense—and though these are but aspects of the same basic concept
they are very much worth distinguishing for analytic purposes. In the
first, what is stressed is the manipulation of symbol structures so as
to bring them, more or less closely, into parallel with the
pre-established nonsymbolic system, as when we grasp how dams work by
developing a theory of hydraulics or constructing a flow chart. The
theory or chart models physical relationships in such a way—that is,
by expressing their structure in synoptic form—as to render them
apprehensible; it is a model of "reality." In the second, what is
stressed is the manipulation of the nonsymbolic systems in terms of
the relationships expressed in the symbolic, as when we construct a
dam according to the specifications implied in an hydraulic theory or
the conclusions drawn from a flow chart. Here, the theory is a model
under whose guidance physical relationships are organized: it is a
model for "reality." For psychological and social systems, and for
cultural models that we would not ordinarily refer to as "theories,"
but rather as "doctrines," "melodies," or "rites," the case is in no
way different. Unlike genes, and other nonsymbolic information
sources, which are only models for, not models of, culture patterns
have an intrinsic double aspect: they give meaning, that is, objective
conceptual form, to social and psychological reality both by shaping
themselves to it and by shaping it to themselves.

<p> ther sorts of significative forms. Models for are found, as the
gene example suggests, through the whole order of nature; for wherever
there is a communication of pattern, such programs are, in simple
logic, required. Among animals, imprint learning is perhaps the most
striking example, because what such learning involves is the automatic
presentation of an appropriate sequence of behavior by a model animal
in the presence of a learning animal which serves, equally
automatically, to call out and stabilize a certain set of responses
genetically built into the learning animal.9 The communicative dance
of two bees, one of which has found nectar and the other of which
seeks it, is another, somewhat different, more complexly coded,
example.10 Craik has even suggested that the thin trickle of water
which first finds its way down from a mountain spring to the sea and
smooths a little channel for the greater volume of water that follows
after it plays a sort of model for function.11 But models
of—linguistic, graphic, mechanical, natural, etc., processes which
function not to provide sources of information in terms of which other
processes can be patterned, but to represent those patterned processes
as such, to express their structure in an alternative medium—are much
rarer and may perhaps be confined, among living animals, to man. The
perception of the structural congruence between one set of processes,
activities, relations, entities, and so on, and another set for which
it acts as a program, so that the program can be taken as a
representation, or conception—a symbol—of the programmed, is the
essence of human thought. The intertransposability of models for and
models of which symbolic formulation makes possible is the distinctive
characteristic of our mentality.

<br>
So far as religious symbols and symbol systems are concerned this
intertransposability is clear. The endurance, courage, independence,
perseverance, and passionate willfulness in which the vision quest
practices the Plains Indian are the same flamboyant virtues by which
he attempts to live: while achieving a sense of revelation he
stabilizes a sense of direction. The consciousness of defaulted
obligation, secreted guilt, and, when a confession is obtained, public
shame in which Manus' seance rehearses him are the same sentiments
that underlie the sort of duty ethic by which his property-conscious
society is maintained: the gaining of an absolution involves the
forging of a conscience.13 And the same self-discipline which rewards
a Javanese mystic staring fixedly into the flame of a lamp with what
he takes to be an intimation of divinity drills him in that rigorous
control of emotional expression which is necessary to a man who would
follow a quietistic style of life.14 Whether one sees the conception
of a personal guardian spirit, a family tutelary, or an immanent God
as synoptic formulations of the character of reality or as templates
for producing reality with such a character seems largely arbitrary, a
matter of which aspect, the model of or model for, one wants for the
moment to bring into focus. The concrete symbols involved--one or
another mythological figure materializing in the wilderness, the skull
of the deceased household head hanging censoriously in the rafters, or
a disembodied "voice in the stillness" soundlessly chanting enigmatic
classical poetry--point in either direction. They both express the
world's climate and shape it.

<p> 

They shape it by inducing in the worshipper a certain distinctive set
of dispositions (tendencies, capacities, propensities, skills, habits,
liabilities, pronenesses) which lend a chronic character to the flow
of his activity and the quality of his experience. A disposition
describes not an activity or an occurrence but a probability of an
activity being performed or an occurrence occurring in certain
circumstances: "When a cow is said to be a ruminant, or a man is said
to be a cigarette-smoker, it is not being said that the cow is
ruminating now or that the man is smoking a cigarette now. To be a
ruminant is to tend to ruminate from time to time, and to be a
cigarette-smoker is to be in the habit of smoking cigarettes."15
Similarly, to be pious is not to be performing something we would call
an act of piety, but to be liable to perform such acts. So, too, with
the Plains Indian's bravura, the Manus' compunctiousness, or the
Javanese's quietism, which, in their contexts, form the substance of
piety. The virtue of this sort of view of what are usually called
"mental traits" or, if the Cartesianism is unavowed, "psychological
forces" (both unobjectionable enough terms in themselves) is that it
gets them out of any dim and inaccessible realm of private sensation
into that same well-lit world of observables in which reside the
brittleness of glass, the inflammability of paper, and, to return to
the metaphor, the dampness of England.
<p>

So far as religious activities are concerned (and learning a myth by
heart is as much a religious activity as detaching one's finger at the
knuckle), two somewhat different sorts of disposition are induced by
them: moods and motivations.

<p> 

A motivation is a persisting tendency, a chronic inclination to
perform certain sorts of acts and experience certain sorts of feeling
in certain sorts of situations, the "sorts" being commonly very
heterogenous and rather ill-defined classes in all three cases:
<p>

On hearing that a man is vain [i.e., motivated by vanity] we expect
him to behave in certain ways, namely to talk a lot about himself, to
cleave to the society of the eminent, to reject criticisms, to seek
the footlights and to disengage himself from conversations about the
merits of others. We expect him to indulge in roseate daydreams about
his own successes, to avoid recalling past failures and to plan for
his own advancement. To be vain is to tend to act in these and
innumerable other kindred ways. Certainly we also expect the vain man
to feel certain pangs and flutters in certain situations; we expect
him to have an acute sinking feeling when an eminent person forgets
his name, and to feel buoyant of heart and light of toe on hearing of
the misfortunes of his rivals. But feelings of pique and buoyancy are
not more directly indicative of vanity than are public acts of
boasting or private acts of daydreaming.16
<p>

Similarly for any motivations. As a motive, "flamboyant courage"
consists in such enduring propensities as to fast in the wilderness,
to conduct solitary raids on enemy camps, and to thrill to the thought
of counting coup. "Moral circumspection" consists in such ingrained
tendencies as to honor onerous promises, to confess secret sins in the
face of severe public disapproval, and to feel guilty when vague and
generalized accusations are made at seances. And "dispassionate
tranquility" consists in such persistent inclinations as to maintain
one's poise come hell or high water, to experience distaste in the
presence of even moderate emotional displays, and to indulge in
contentless contemplations of featureless objects. Motives are thus
neither acts (that is, intentional behaviors) nor feelings, but
liabilities to perform particular classes of act or have particular
classes of feeling. And when we say that a man is religious, that is,
motivated by religion, this is at least part--though only part--of
what we mean.

<p> 

Another part of what we mean is that he has, when properly stimulated,
a susceptibility to fall into certain moods, moods we sometimes lump
together under such covering terms as "reverential," "solemn," or
"worshipful." Such generalized rubrics actually conceal, however, the
enormous empirical variousness of the dispositions involved, and, in
fact, tend to assimilate them to the unusually grave tone of most of
our own religious life. The moods that sacred symbols induce, at
different times and in different places, range from exultation to
melancholy, from self-confidence to self-pity, from an incorrigible
playfulness to a bland listlessness--to say nothing of the erogenous
power of so many of the world's myths and rituals. No more than there
is a single sort of motivation one can call piety is there a single
sort of mood one can call worshipful.

 
<p>

The major difference between moods and motivations is that where the
latter are, so to speak, vectorial qualities, the former are merely
scalar. Motives have a directional cast, they describe a certain
overall course, gravitate toward certain, usually temporary,
consummations. But moods vary only as to intensity: they go
nowhere. They spring from certain circumstances but they are
responsive to no ends. Like fogs, they just settle and lift; like
scents, suffuse and evaporate. When present they are totalistic: if
one is sad everything and everybody seems dreary; if one is gay,
everything and everybody seems splendid. Thus, though a man can be
vain, brave, willful, and independent at the same time, he can't very
well be playful and listless, or exultant and melancholy, at the same
time.17 Further, where motives persist for more or less extended
periods of time, moods merely recur with greater or lesser frequency,
coming and going for what are often quite unfathomable reasons. But
perhaps the most important difference, so far as we are concerned,
between moods and motivations is that motivations are "made
meaningful" with reference to the ends toward which they are conceived
to conduce, whereas moods are "made meaningful" with reference to the
conditions from which they are conceived to spring. We interpret
motives in terms of their consummations, but we interpret moods in
terms of their sources. We say that a person is industrious because he
wishes to succeed; we say that a person is worried because he is
conscious of the hanging threat of nuclear holocaust. And this is no
less the case when the interpretations are ultimate. Charity becomes
Christian charity when it is enclosed in a conception of God's
purposes; optimism is Christian optimism when it is grounded in a
particular conception of God's nature. The assiduity of the Navaho
finds its rationale in a belief that, since "reality" operates
mechanically, it is coercible; their chronic fearfulness finds its
rationale in a conviction that, however "reality" operates, it is both
enormously powerful and terribly dangerous.

   <summary>Tulalip Tribe's summary</summary>

From the Tulalip Tribe's <a href="https://tulaliplushootseed.com/story-tellers/harry-moses/" target="_blank">website</a>:

Harry Moses was born on November 15, 1878 up the Skagit river Valley
in the town of Marblemount. Harry and his wife Jessie had eight
children, William Moses, Zatha Moses, Regina Moses Dallaire, Persina H
Moses, Mahcina L Moses, Rydnillo W Moses, Anna B Moses and Arnold C
Moses.
<p>
Harry’s father was Will-Ab-To-Chub Charley Moses, who was born in  1853.
 His mother was Sha-Sha-Bow-Lits-Ah or Mary, she was born in  1852. Jesse’s father was Bon-Quah-am.

<p>
The Moses family were heavily involved with their relatives and fellow
members of the Shaker church. They lived mainly in the Upper Skagit
area, around Marblemount. They spent a good deal of time with the
Anderson family. Vi Hilbert in Haboo wrote that her, and her parents,
visited quite often because her parents thoroughly enjoyed each
other’s company. She wrote, “I loved to listen in.

Harry had a wonderful sense of humor, which was well known. He loved
to tell stories and his audience knew that they could count on him to
embellish the facts, with a twinkle in his eyes. Why, Harry saw the
eyes of the woman in the moon, and the fish he caught in the Cascade
river behind his house were so big that when he lifted them onto his
shoulder, the tails would drag far behind him on the ground.

Harry died on October 24, 1955 in Sedro-Woolley.

  <summary>An indirect account of Harry Moses's social setting</summary>

(from the introduction to Sally Snyder's dissertation, 
Skagit society and its existential basis: an ethnofolkloristic reconstruction. University of Washington, 1964)

Non-reservation Indians who lived in and near towns were descended
from people who inhabited areas less accessible and attractive to
Whites. Those Skagits had resisted in battle removal to
reservations. Except for that unfortunate meeting with Whites who were
of the military, and a few surveyors and miners passing through now
and then, significant contacts with Caucasians were not until after
1875 with the first pioneer settlers in their area.

During the years I knew non-reservation Skagits they were also
surrounded by White neighbors and were even more of a minority
population where they lived than Reservation Indians. But they were
economically independent, with standards of living which did not
distinguish them from Caucasian neighbors. They seemed to have been
socially and psychologically more stable than reservation
people. Despite the physical isolation of upriver families from other
Indians - so different from the community setting of reservations -
 there was more unity among them. Cultural decay had progressed no
further, if as far, than for reservation Skagits. But it had been
supplanted by Western elements which had led not to the
disorganization, disturbances, and hopelessness I saw on the
Reservation, but to a degree of positive identification as being both
Indians and members of a predominantly White community.

In the years I knew and worked with Skagits on the Reservation and
elsewhere, only memories about native culture had been preserved
intact, and these were limited to the elderly and a few of the
middle-aged. No one under forty spoke or understood more than a few
words of an Indian language. My researches were on last survivors of
an aboriginal culture.
